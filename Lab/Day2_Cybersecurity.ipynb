              "'The airport is certainly tiny! Arriving there was good off the plane quick straight onto a connecting bus to Brussels. Staff at the information stand were helpful & spoke English. The outbound journey wasn\\'t as pleasant security was over zealous (having to remove belt watch etc) and very unfriendly. Didn\\'t bother using the \\'canteen\\' in the cupboard (departure lounge 1) and there was a big crush fighting fellow passengers to get on the aircraft. The toilets in the lounge were filthy stinking & graffitid. Having said that for a flight that cost about the same as a pizza it\\'s worth putting up with and I\\'d use it again.Small airports are generally intimate friendly and welcoming. Not so with Charleroi. It is dirty seriously overcrowded at peak times and facilities are terrible. Ryanair does a good job of running a base on these facilities mind. Links to Brussels are good but that\\'s really thanks to Ryanair themselves. Food is terrible and waiting areas are not so conducive to extended stays (extended being anything more than 15 minutes)Waited an hour in a corridor for baggage but ours was the only arrival in 3 hours. Waited 45 mins for the bus driver to let people on then he went off for a 30 min fag break which meant we missed the connecting train to Brussels we could have walked quicker to town centre. Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet. It was a relief when the exits opened and we all made a charge for our non pre-allocated seats. Cheap but not cheerful next time I will pay the extra and fly direct from Manchester to Brussels Zaventem.The previous comment is so off the mark it must have been written by one of the \"anti-Ryanair\" squad. Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their \"connectional\" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don\\'t ever take criticism - just offer a \"Gallic shrug\". A \"joined-up public transport service\" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don\\'t die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission\\'s latest investigation hasn\\'t scuppered the Ryanair operation by then. I have no connection with Charleroi Airport nor with Ryanair (the only flight operator).The airport resulbles a shack. A very bad cafe and unfriendly staff across the whole airport. I will never use this airport again. It is a nightmare even trying to get to this excuse of an airport. My advice to anybody thinking of using this airport use Brussels National insteade.This is an incredibly confusing airport. Check in was fine but the passage to the gates winds through poorly marked duty free stores. Security was also good but by the third time you have to ask yourself \"where to now?\" the frustration has built. If I had been in a hurry I would have become furious.Zaventem my home airport. Lots of nostalgic childhood memories because of the Sabena frequent flyer status of my father. Nowadays very nice check in lounge lots of good food drinking options Zaventem was and is Belgium\\'s number one airport. The luggage pick up is still too slow. Smoking lounges too overcrowded and too small. But despite this few minor negative points Zaventem is a good organised clean airport its still the number one hub in Europe.Brussels to Zurich - The first impression was a disorderly airport and long queues. Not a very appealing interior ill-planned layout of the airport makes you go up and down several times. Not many things to look for while waiting for the flight. This airport is clearly not at par with other European standard airports.I flew from BRU on a transatlantic flight to New York. I arrived well in time but the Airport security had a 2 hour waiting line at the passport check. This meant that I almost missed my flight which was extremely frustrating. I cannot comprehend why this Airport is so incompetent in one of its main duties. I recommend flying out of AMS or DUS.I\\'ve read some of the critical reviews on this site and while Brussels airport is not the best airport I know I believe things have got better lately. The frequency of trains to and from the airport has increased some trains are still the old shuttle trains from Brussels but others are the very reasonable longer distance trains running through Belgium. The roadworks close to the airport are over. But more roadworks could be planned. The departure hall can be crowded but some low cost flights are now handled in a separate extension of the departure hall making room in the rest of the airport. The Schengen gates used to be accessible via a long underground tunnel with lots of escalators. These have gone now: there is a new \\'connector\\' building that is much more pleasant to go to the A gates. The new shops toilets restaurants in the A gates area look nice some restaurants still close relatively early. The non-Schengen gates are less bright but the new connector building now also improves the transfer from A to C gates and vice-versa. On my last visit to the airport my luggage was on the luggage retrieval belt before I got there so zero wait. The arrival hall is still the low-ceiling area it used to be quite unwelcoming.1) Please stop continuously changing gates! On our most recent trip it was changed an unbelievable 5 times! 2) Invest in an adequate loudspeaker system. 3) The acoustic is from the dark ages. 4) Various areas are not covered by working loudspeakers. 5) Train the announcers to articulate to slow down. 6) Employ people with excellent foreign language skills or native speakers. 7) Install more info counters. 8) Learn from \"top\" airports.As long as I live I will never get a connecting flight from this airport again nightmare of a journey from Gates A to B if your on a tight connecting flight expect to be running around. Expect very poor signage and awful attitude from airport staff and officials.I am a regular visitor of Zaventem Airport unfortunately because it is one of the worst airports in Europe. Traffic to the airport is a nightmare. Narrow and always blocked by never ending roadworks. Trains to the airport are dirty and at least 40 year old wrecks and you pay an horrendous price. Ticket area for trains is small dirty and always full with people queuing for the one single open sales point. (Machines do not accept foreign cards or credit cards.) Luggage delivery takes an average of 1.5 hours (yes 1.5 hours) almost a world record. Waiting time for the passport control can be up to 2 hours. The non-Schengen shopping area is almost non-existent. -Cleanliness and overall the state of maintenance is very poor. My advise go to Paris CDG. From there 1h 12m TGV to Brussels. That\\'s much quicker as fighting yourself trough the Zaventem chaos.I had the bad luck to spend 3 hours at EBBR in the transfer area. My connection flight to England with Brussels Airlines was delayed 2hrs which was actually good because the ways from the arrival gate to the departure gate B30 was a nightmare of a walk. After passing through yet another security land and yet another passport check (Schengen my butt) I had to walk another few kilometres to the gate in order to wait there for my flight. Being used to rather posh German airports the overall appearance of this airport was: a bland megalomaniac hellhole of gigantic boredom with everything outdated. Endless corridors to the gates and ending with dirty and tasteless seats in the waiting areas not to mention the toilets. It\\'s like entering a 3rd-world country. If you are a smoker you\\'ll appreciate the extremely sparse smoking areas. Very few bistros (I actually saw only one) that close very soon in the evening and a saddening mass of saddening vending machines top off the overall horrible experience with that airport. If I can avoid passing though EBBR I\\'ll pay any amount of Euros to do so.Worst airport visited. Long line up for immigration and no indication at all first line up 30 minutes then an airport staff member told us that we were at the wrong line we had headed to another line for international passengers even longer we spent 1 hour and 15 minutes to get through the immigration which was my flight departure time. Air Canada staff were kindly waiting for us at the last minute.I will never book a trip with Brussels airport as the transfer point. While the airport facilities were good transferring from hall A to Hall B is a disaster. We were leaving Europe and it is necessary to line up for passport review. There was a line 150 feet long about 200 people and they only have 2 stations to serve you. Serve is the wrong word it took 40 minutes to get through this point. The two staff were rude. They have very poor signage and it turned out that one line was for Euro Zone residents and the other for non Euro people. People were crowded into lines trying to get to the front only to be told they were in the wrong one. People were complaining because they were going to miss their flights. It was chaos. Then to top it off this young Passport Control supervisor yells at everyone that if they don\\'t calm down he \"will close the border\"! The root problem is that this transfer area is only designed to have two kiosks. They can\\'t even put more staff on. The worst bottleneck design I have seen in my many years travelling.Having arrived from Montreal (YUL) after originally departing from Toronto (YYZ) and being about 03.00 by my body clock I found my way to passport control ok reasonable queue very nice officers and then off to Duty Free before connecting to Bristol (BRS). Arriving in the non-Schengen zone my connection was also in the same zone so I headed off to the desk for the connection on my ticket. A quick trip through fast track security and off to the gate. Seems that I missed that flight and the desk agent ran off to do something or other to get me moving. She returned and handed me a new ticket for KLM to AMS. Back though passport control again no queue at all same nice officers and off to the other terminal. The ticket barcode access scanner for fast track security tells me to go to the original terminal and refuses to open so I just jump the rail and tell a security person on duty about the plane change who lets me through with no question. Second time through security scanning another passport stamp (3 in 1 hour) and off to the gate. Agent says to me with a dirty look that she was looking for me hours ago. Explained the changes and delays she turned pleasant checked me in and hit my seat with moments to spare. All in all it was a bit of a crazy time but it worked out and I had no real issues with any staff clerks officers at all. Will be back at BRU again next June when I\\'ll have a one day stop-over to properly suss out the airport. But until then I give it a Recommended rating.Awful possibly the worst transfer I\\'ve ever done. B gates are very old and shabby and involve a huge walk from the A terminal. Had to go through baggage claim and security again despite only travelling between Portugal and the UK on a connecting code share flight. Also had to argue for quite some time to allow my duty free to travel through security. Final insult was that my connecting flight was heavily delayed with very little information and the bars all closed at 7.30 despite there being a World Cup on and flights still leaving up to 11. Terrible experience will avoid like the plague.I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess. While everyone is waiting for his luggage you may have to collect more revenue from parking.Worst airport I have ever been in after 60 years of travelling all over the world. There was incorrect labelling of connections and we were sent in the wrong direction by an airport staff member who was directing passengers. This caused us to miss a very tight connection. Security was so offensive.Using Brussels airport for transit was a nightmare this morning. All transit passengers have to go through long queues for passport control and security which led the flight delay overunning outgoing flight time. This was delayed luckily - but passenger announcements were not made to let those involved know. Just that the last call had been made. The distance between the incoming gates and outgoing gates is truly enormous - but why when we were put on a bus to drive a further few kms to get to the aircraft? Why not have bus after a short walk if it has to go that far? Why were the Security staff telling us to go back to the check in desk to get another flight (and have to go through Passport Control and Security again) without first checking if the flight was being held (which they did at the second attempt)? Finally on arrival at destination - no baggage - it is still a Brussels. I will not try these routes again.29 July 2013. Worst Airport in Europe. Had to fly out of here on busy day. Allowed 3 hours. Small signs. Rude personnel apart from check-in man who was good. Tax refund department quote \"this is not my regular job\" as he dropped forms (losing 2 permanently) and shuffled papers. Huge queues. Unable to process English tax forms at Travelex in Brussels Airport. Poor duty free. Limited calls for airline lucky to reach airline on last call despite allowing 3 hours for check in.Missed connecting flight due to huge backlog in passport customs control. In addition to this did not receive luggage to and from destination due to baggage handlers work to rule strike. Too much ground to cover when making a connecting flight.Having to go from section A to B entails having to go through security and passport control and the distance is very long. This would not be an issue if there was plenty of time between flights. The 3 factors combined distance + passport control + security resulted in my being bumped of the flight as the airline thought 30 mins was not enough time to get from sector A to B. Then there is the baggage handlers strike which has added fuel to fire on the return. We have not heard from Swissport who handlers baggage on the status of the strike. The website does not recognize the airline tag when you try and get the status of your baggage. Almost a week later and no one has bothered to contact the passengers either by email or by phone. We had to wait 2 hours to get file our lost luggage claim in Paris. I lost money for the pre-paid taxi as a result which Swissport said they would not pay. So all in all I would not recommend flying through Brussels airport.This is my local airport which I use regularly. Easy access and plentiful parking. Spacious clean and easy to navigate terminals. Queues through security now shorter than previously. Good selection of shops and restaurants/cafes in the Schengen terminal. Major negative for me is the interminable time it takes to retrieve gold clubs on arrival and often having to \"go looking\" for them. Probably the worst airport I have experienced on this point.Transited through BRU en-route to ORD. The airport is nice and clean though dated. Did not look flashy like O\\'Hare. Staff are helpful. Quiet understated airport. The cafe was nice and selection of food excellent. Not crowded like many other Airports in Europe but duty free selection is nice. This is a good airport for transiting. Not a madhouse like LHR. Was bussed to the waiting Sabena plane.Having travelled around the world I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport which happens to be my home airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Many times the plane cannot get to the gate because ground staff are not present so we have to wait. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess with several planes on 1 carrousel and the next carrousel empty. Cleanliness is so poor the restrooms smell and are dirty the waiting seats are dirty.The airport does what it needs to do but no more. Access - by bus in/out: long waiting outside overloaded no space for baggage connecting with public transport requires carrying luggage down on crowded narrow stairs - very uncomfortable! By train: in house sometimes very dirty trains no space for baggage - more comfortable better access to the public transport system. Taxis are comfortable but hard to find at first time. Inside walking distances - Prepare yourself for long walks changing levels 3 times up and down on escalators and a huge queue in front of the security screening area in the evenings. Plan 60 mins to arrive at the boarding gate as net fast walk time exceeds 20 mins and wait time at the screening can take 30 mins. Toilets - There are many toilets they are easy to find. There are no toilets in the lounges. Flight information - There is usually no gate information on the screens until -30 of departure but it will be printed on the boarding pass at check-in. WIFI is available but expensive. Restaurants are good but expensive. Lounges are overloaded with people in the evening. The food is far below average. Boarding goes smoothly and usually directly from the terminal over a gangway. Baggage claim - Expect your luggage to be late. Overall nothing is horrible but it\\'s a quite uncomfortable airport for European standards.I used the airport in October 2012. Since it was a morning flight I arrived at the airport by the first train! Had plenty of time to explore the airport. Check in with SN Brussels airlines bound to Milan was smooth. Security control also fast enough. The immigration agent friendly. Found the airport fairly passenger friendly easy to find way out with good signage everywhere.Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminalsI arrived from Warsaw in the evening on 12th September. The airport was having peak hours with many arrivals and departures at the same time. However it was easy to navigate around the airport due to clear and good signages. It was a long walk from the aircraft however luggage was on the belt when we arrived at the luggage claim area. The train service to and from the airport was good where I was in the city less than 90 minutes from the time we landed.Used this airport on the 4th of August for my trip to Bangkok via Istanbul. The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff. At terminal B there were a lots of shops after passport control and before security. And after security there was also a bar and Duty Free shop.Landed tonight one of the last flights. Waited for 30 minutes for a gate agent to get the jetway so we could leave the plane. You may as well fly to Antwerp and walk to Brussels given how far Terminal A is from the exit. You\\'d think they would have put in a train or shuttle. Nope. Why do something that would add to the customer experience? Never check your bags at BRU or you will be over an hour before you get out. In short the ground staff are next to useless the design of the terminals is daft and often requires a hiking expedition to get to your flight and the customer service is often profoundly rude bordering on incompetent.Security queues can be long here at busy times with only some of the lines open. Apart from that its an efficient airport except that the distances involves can be large. Be especially careful if you are transferring from the A gates to B gates as the distance between is long (I would allow 45 mins just to get from one gate to the other).In the summer I wrote a review criticising two aspect of Brussels airportHorrible airport long queues no signs telling you where to go. The toilet facilities are quite bad. I was in the passport-queue for 45 minutes. I had quite a lot of hand luggage and I couldn\\'t find a single hand luggage cart! To top it all you have to pay for the liquid gel bags? Very inefficient and hostile airport.This is one of the most inefficient airports. This airport is not really adapted for internal European flights. For a 1 hr flight you need to walk at least 15 minutes before having a chance to reach the exit and if by misfortune you had checked in bags then you won\\'t be out of the airport in less than 30 mins minimum.DEL-BRU-GVA. Arrived on a Jet airways flight. Landed at T-B onward connection to Geneva from T-1 Brussels Airlines. I am a Swiss Citizens so didn\\'t have to go through the non-EU passport control long queue. Got to the Security check and as expected long queue there. Finally boarded my flight to Geneva with few minutes to spare. I can assure you that if I was a non-EU citizen my flight would have left.Although it\\'s becoming an important European hub Zaventem airport still keep a \"human\" size and moving between and within terminals is quite easy. Organized efficiently there are a lot of shopping and eating options lounges are well located and lines in migration customs and security-checks run efficiently. Staff overall are friendly.BRU is easy to get around and walking distances were short. Luggage took a bit longer to be unloaded on arrival but otherwise no complaints. We arrived at about 7.30 am for our return flight to Canada and virtually skipped through security. One negative at least as far as I could see - on arrival at the airport we were looking forward to a relaxed breakfast before our flight however there were no sit down restaurants within sight of our departure gate.This airport gives me a nice home-feel not too big and overcrowded and yet all the services one needs (shops lounges). Security lines can be long at rush hour but not exaggerated.Pleasant airport lots of shops and restaurants bit overpriced. Lounges are too small always overcrowded. Airport is clean but not spotless (room for improvement) and you need to walk a lot to get to your gate. The A terminal is 1km in length and it takes about 15min to get there from the main entrance building. The luggage control is over crowded too.BRU is quite inefficient. The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault. However the long walks and 20mins for security check definitely are. Strong advice - please arrive at this airport at least 2hrs prior to departure esp if flying Brussels airlines.I have used Brussels 4-6 times a year for about 20 years. Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient. As usual there were two sales points open and queues stretched out of the booking hall.Has no electricity connectors foreseen for visitors of other countries. Waiting on your luggage becomes longer and longer every month. In the beginning luggage took around 15mins to claim now you have to wait around 45-60 mins.Well organized airport with GOOD security checks. Queues are well organized processing is speedy with helpful attendants. Good selection of shops and food-outlets once you are through security. Restaurants fairly priced and courteous staff. Good selection of authentic Belgian products at competitive prices.Flew several times to/from BRU. Generally positive experience. Last time efficient check-in quick passport and smooth security (though it wasn\\'t anything near rush hour). The walk to the gate saves you time in a gymI use Brussels Airport every time so on average 20 times a year. It\\'s very easy to reach by public transport and by car (there were some rush hour queues when the infrastructure was being rebuilt but that\\'s finished now) very difficult to find a parking space close to the terminal on busy days. Kiss and ride zone works very efficiently when Police are patrolling without Police it\\'s chaos because people leave their car parked. In 90% of the times never had to wait more than 30 minutes for checking in (I don\\'t bother checking in online or using the machines) Staff is usually very friendly and they know multiple languages. Security can be really bad on some days so expect long queues. Again in about 80% of the time got through in less than half an hour. Terminal A is modern very spacious and very nice to be in but about 15 minutes of walking from the check-in area. Terminal B is older but does not look aged less shops and less seating. Baggage drop off was very efficient my luggage would be waiting on the belt but that\\'s changed after some worker strikes. Expect 20-30 minutes of wait (when you arrive at the belt which is also about 20 minutes after arrival at the gate).Transited BRU earlier this month. Total chaos. Landed from MXP in terminal B long walk to terminal A for connecting flight to PHL. Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate. Very little to look at air side no food nor shopping this was mainly pre security as was duty free kiosk so could not get that stamped forfeiting the refund. Not the best experience.I have never had a good experience at Brussels Airport. Travelling to Africa via Brussels makes you feel like a third class citizen (whatever your skin colour). You are almost forced into using a transfer bus from a virtually unheated part of the airport. If you can find another way to Africa that does not involve passing through Brussels take it.Flew from the UK to Oslo via Brussels Airport return. Signage and directions were extremely confusing and the security staff were rude and arrogant. I don\\'t know how old the Airport is but the facilities were dated and unclean.Clean easy to access at low price from city centre by train. Confusing in the check-in zone but once you pass security fantastic shopping plenty of space to sit good indications and long distances so enough time is needed to join the flights to Africa.BOM-BRU-CDG. Transit through BRU on Jet Airways. Landed at 0750 at concourse B with onward flight to CDG at 0940 from concourse A. After a long walk through concourse B reached passport control. 4 counters operating for non EU citizens with more than 200 people in line. Took an agonizing 1 hour and 10 min to clear. Again a long walk to reach concourse A. Security check took another 10 min. Had to rush to my gate to avoid missing the flight and reached just 2 minutes before scheduled departure time. No clear or enough directions to reach the gates. I guess the airlines are used to it and they waited for an additional 15-20 minutes for passengers who were stuck in the BRU maze. Please avoid transiting through BRU if you can or allow at least 3 hours to transit.Access to and from the airport is easy by car or rail. If you arrive too early for check in there is no seating so either be prepared to stand or come a bit later. Security checks can be tiring - depending of course on how many people are waiting in line. Was not required to take off shoes since they have a new machine that you simply stand on. I was however required to take off my belt and every once in about three times I used this airport was body searched as well. Once you go through all the hassle it gets more calm there is usually enough seating and the waiting is OK. All in all a clean and efficient airport. The only really bother: you may have a very long walk from arrival gate to passport control since the terminal is a long corridor. If you\\'re lucky you will land closer to the terminal.I used to like travelling through Brussels Airport : not anymore ! The few last month the airport experience has turned from pleasant to very anoying due to the lack of staff . Lack of staff at check in with Brussels airlines : the airline is trying to force everybody to check on line and the result is long queues at the airport. Lack of staff at boarding pass control : another line before getting to the terminal. Lack of staff at security where now you have to take off shoes every time with rude and bored staff and queues getting longer each month. Altogether a very bad experience and no time left to spend some time and money in the shops.Cool modern design and lots of space to sit. I arrived in BRU too early and thus had a long wait for my flight and found you have to pay for the wireless internet. No entertainment thus. The free charging stations for your laptop/cell phone were useful though. Toilets clean (despite someone had been smoking in there). What I really found annoying was the journey to the luggage claim up and down escalators and long corridors. I also didn\\'t realize the exit was in the middle of the luggage claim area and not in the end and thus wandered around looking a bit lost. There was also no mailbox after the security check - I forgot to mail my postcards before going in. The maps claimed there should\\'ve been one but I really couldn\\'t find it. Rail connection to Brussels ok railway station sterile and boring.Good airport I have used it a few times nice and clean. Never really had the chance to check duty free though. But be prepared to walk and I mean really walk 3 floors down and then under the park bays (?) and 3 floors up. The designer should have been a health freak.. the last thing I want when rushing to meetings is a 20 minute jog to exit an airport!Terminal A is a dreadful place where one can easily got lost. When arriving there\\'s an endless walk to the exit with escalators up and down and miles of moving walkways with few and confusing signs in this shopping of an airport. Finding the train station is quite a challenge too. The automatic tickets vending machines only accept Belgium cards. On the positive side it\\'s a clean place full of natural light but designed by someone who never use airports!Nice airport but they do love their escalators don\\'t they? There is one after another to go anywhere. It is almost comical. I had heard about this but seeing it in person made me laugh. Grab a piece of chocolate to keep your energy up!Terminal A for Schengen flights is quite comfortable with much natural daylight and plenty of seating areas. But it is quite a long walk to the baggage claim area using numerous escalators. Catering is good and reasonably priced. Trains to downtown Brussels run every 20min and are cheap. Please note that the ticket vending machines accept Euro coins only and no credit cards. Signals in the check-in halls could be improved as it is rather difficult to locate the right counter.Very long queues for security tonight in zone B in Brussels. At least a 400m queue to reach the scanners it started just after the passport check desks and it was slow moving. This did not seem to have any obvious cause. With the mega long walks you can have here a good reason to be prudent.Brussels Airport is convenient and most of the time easy to travel through. Bright and airy the Shengen terminal is much better than the older one and also offers more opportunities for shopping. Recently longs queues for security have appeared and the airport management should find a solution to this problem.BRU Zaventem Airport has made significant improvements over the last couple of years. I was in and out of this airport almost monthly for 4 years and despite most often using the rather old B concourse they have not only built additional gates but also invested in some upgrades. Arrival is still a bit odd with long walks from gate to immigration counters in concourse B and with sometimes long queues. However airport staff is friendly and security is strict but done in a friendly manner. Overall a 3 to 4 stars in Europe. With improved intercontinental connections and one of the best intra-Europe network this airport has good potential to become even better and more attractive to travellers.I use Brussels airport a lot and it is a good airport which has got better over the past couple of years. The cafes are good and not too expensive when compared with places like Heathrow. The train service should be improved though as it only accepts Belgian debit cards and normally only 1 machine works. As everyone is coming from abroad this doesn\\'t make much sense.A well run and well maintained airport with friendly and efficient staff. Frequent and reasonably priced train link into central Brussels. Didn\\'t use the shops or catering so can\\'t comment there. If your flight comes in at the far end of pier A then you\\'re in for quite a hike to the train station/taxi pick up and the signing seems to fizzle out towards the end but otherwise a very good experience.The negative aspects are high prices in restaurants and car parking. Although there is a single terminal there are two departure areas - \"A\" for Schengen zone countries (i.e. no passport controls) and \"B\" for non-Schengen (including the UK and Ireland). Passengers travelling through area \"B\" have a far shorter walk to/from the \\'planes. Flights occasionally arrive at area \"A\" from non-Schengen countries - this is usually when bus transfers are necessary (so that passengers have to pass through passport control). A good recent development are the direct trains from the airport to Leuven as well as Brussels. A little known bus link is the hourly De Lijn service 359 to/from Roodebeek Metro station - useful for the east side of Brussels.Zaventem is good clean and friendly. The food is pricey. The train connection is excellent but the taxis are a crude rip off. We are stuck with the never-ending tunnel to terminal A but the terminal is nice when you get there. Do something about people parking on the forecourt. And bussing when you land is hateful time consuming and stressful.Improvement in cleanliness and staff. Smooth process for drop-off, security, frontier and boarding, fast baggage on belt at return. Smokers friendly airport. The food/ drinks in restaurants are expensive for Romanian standards, at least. Nearly missed my plane, in spite of arriving at airport in good time. One of two Security Gates has to be chosen according to designated Departure Gate, but latter is not shown on screen in Departures Hall. Security itself was chaotic. I was ordered into a queue which took more than twenty-five minutes just to reach the scanning equipment (one man was observing two scanners at once). After my laptop was scanned, I was told to start it up and then turn it off, meaning even more time was lost. Passport control was slow: in total it took more than thirty-five minutes between entering security and entering the departure lounge, by which time my flight was closing.We transferred from a TAROM flight to KLM and our experience was smooth. The facilities airside are two folded the last part of the pier with our boarding gate (12) was looking nice and modern the first part looked bit shabby and worn down seen the economic reality in Romania it was high standard. I can\\'t make any statement about the landside but the transfer security was lacking proper English skills and it was hard to communicate and get what they wanted which gives you the impression that these people are rude. In fact they aren\\'t if you look into their body language as well.The worst airport I have been to. Early morning flight and airport was very busy. Several kiosks were not working and only one person there to help. She was very rude and not trying to help. Everyone kept telling us to go to someone else for help with boarding pass but could never talk to anyone. No one seemed to care that a large group of us were having a problem getting boarding passes. Lines for security were chaos. No one directing people and everyone just pushing in together. Terrible experience.Quick friendly security screening. Short lines at passport control. However smoking areas not well controlled and was forced to breathe second hand smoke for 40 minutes sitting at my gate waiting to board my flight. I travel a lot and this is the only airport in the 15 or so years where I have ever experienced this.A good airport. Very quickly through security which was staffed by polite people. Passport control queues small and staff dealt with all nationalities in a polite manner. Signs throughout the airport were found to be well positioned and also displayed in English. Over-all this a good airport.Excellent airport very large friendly staff beats airports in France or Italy.In general it is a normal airport. There are some shops places to sit etc. bathrooms are relatively clean. However I faced huge issues when I had to use the parking facilities. There is no gratis period for a car to come in and just pick you up for a very short period. This is very inappropriate because afterwards the only way to pay is in the local currency. EUR is not accepted anywhere and the exchange rates are very unfavorable. Moreover they did not accept to exchange small money (in my case 10 EUR). This caused a huge inconvenience for me and I have to say that the staff was not friendly either. I am definitely not keen on coming to this airport again!It was not particularly busy when I arrived and departed but I felt Bucharest was one of the best airport experiences I have had in years. Apart from a short wait to check-in there were no queues anywhere and staff were courteous and friendly throughout. There is plentiful seating and a range of different food outlets (admittedly many selling similar food) and shops. A cheap alternative to a taxi is to use the bus into the city about every 20 minutes and a return ticket costs about 2 euros.We started coming through here in December 2000. It\\'s gone a long ways to finish what they started in the last 13 years but obviously by the other reviews still have a long ways to go in the pre-security departure lounge. However Lavazza is a nice touch because unlike the Starbucks model in which you have to help yourself and clean up your own mess the Lavazza is fastidiously serviced by wait staff who are very polite and attentive.All the people I encountered in this Airport were friendly. It\\'s not what I would say in the league of Singapore\\'s Changi but nevertheless functional in design. Anyone though who has to spend more than 2 hours in the airport would be surely bored. Dining facilities are poor with the same saturated fat selection\\'s. Taxi Fare to the airport from Bucharest Centre should be no more than 30 Leu. Avoid the taxi louts in arrivals or anyone who approaches offering this and that as you would anywhere. They will cost you a small fortune.OTP in fact is two airports in one. The check-in hall the security controls and the passport control areas are old overcrowded messy and do not meet European standards. Once surviving this the departure hall is new and nice with many shops and bars. Especially in the morning it is suggested to arrive pretty early in order to get through the x-ray and passport controls: the queue is totally unorganized time consuming and stressful.Transferred in Bucharest coming from Paris to Oradea. OTP is a small airport quite modern. The issue is that I landed \"International\" in the new terminal had to walk (in a hurry because my transfer was tight) to the old domestic terminal to get my boarding card to find that the door was in fact at the new international terminal and walk back all the way! As there was only 1 line of luggage/passengers inspection open and not very fast that was really limit and I was lucky to board the bus on time. On the way back had some time to spend and could have a nice espresso and pastry in one of the bars. The international terminal is modern and clean but do not expect the facilities and free-tax of Singapore this is just a \"regional\" airport.Well having recently traveled through Henri Coanda airport I found that there is not much before you go through security but when you are there is quite a few shops although for some unknown reason in duty free they will not accept the local currency which is the first airport I have come across that does not. In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks. When in the queue a passport control officer paid for his drink with no problem and when I mentioned it he was so rude but as I was going to go through to depart what can I say would I use this restaurant again definitely not. Would I return to Bucharest again probably not.The usual mix of rude staff expensive food and poor signage. Not enough shops for a capital city airport.One of the best small airports in Europe. You get in and out quickly and the addition of the new terminal still keeps it efficient. Staff are not overly friendly. Lines are short and there may not be a lot to do but that\\'s fine since you never spend long here. Traffic to the centre is much improved but watch out for the taxi touts outside baggage claim.I travel regularly to Bucharest and have been impressed by improvements made to this airport. It is clean directions are well signposted. If you use public transport it is cheap to travel into the City Centre by train or bus. The airport taxis are ok but watch out for taxi touts. To date I have had no problems with luggage on any of my trips through this airport and have had only friendly and efficient treatment by check-in and other staff. Coffee is expensive in the coffee bars though there are some coffee machines . Most facilities can be found here and security is clearly on view.I was positively surprised by the changes that occurred in Henri Coanda Airport in Bucharest. Now it has a new terminal over 40 gates I believe and the duty free is actually open and it works. It still does not accept payment in Romanian Lei (only $US and Euros and potentially credit cards). It does look like a nice airport terminal now once you do the check-in. Before check-in it\\'s still outdated.I connected through OTP from Istanbul to Venice on TAROM. After disembarking all our plane\\'s passengers were made to wait in a hallway unable to enter the main terminal for about half an hour. The guard in charge clearly did not know what to do with anyone. At length someone else showed up and simply opened a door letting everyone enter the terminal not requiring any documents. The gate for our connecting flight to Venice was changed several times -- each time with no notice. The only way passengers knew there had been a change was if they happened to look at the departure board and saw that the gate was different. I found OTP to be decades behind the rest of the world.Arrival at Bucharest Baneasa awful experience. Building is too small to accommodate all arriving passengers. Departures are even worse shady unorganized looking terminal. Security check takes forever and is an inefficient process. Waiting area at the gates too small too accommodate passengers of one flight let alone if 2 flights leave at about the same time.Arrived from Paris to Bucharest OTP. The Tarom plane was allowed direct access. Quite a long walk until you get to the passport control that went quick with Police Officers that have improved a lot since the past days. We were waiting at belt 1 for the luggage as shown on the screen when somebody noticed that our flight was no longer on this screen ! It had been moved to an other belt without notice. 2 days later flew from OTP to Cluj (internal flight) - check- in was quick and efficient waiting-room much too small with not enough seats boarding by bus. All in all not HKG or Singapore but better than some other European airports.I was impressed by the speed of immigration on arrival and received a nice welcome from the officer checking my passport. Customs ignored me and I was out in less than 8 minutes in total. The bus journey into the city centre was -as everyone says- a nightmare. The only way to avoid it is to arrive late in the evening and take a taxi. The departure was different. There does not seem to be room for a queue and if you don\\'t speak Romanian it can be hard to check if you are in the correct queue. Nevertheless it was all fairly friendly and I have seen worse at Heathrow!Although it\\'s only about 10 miles away from Bucharest traffic to and from the airport is a nightmare: depending on the time of day it takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to get there (also beware of incredible rip-offs with the taxisImmigration quickly cleared and baggage quickly appeared. Travel into the city is a nightmare - the road network is wholly inadequate for a developing city. Check in for returning flight was quick with no queue but then very long wait at security probably due to heightened measures ahead of the NATO summit. Departure lounge comfortable if slightly basic but all outlets food and non-food very expensive. Range of food on offer very restricted - OK for a snack but not more (even if you could afford it). All outlets will accept EUR but do not seem to have change.There are separate buildings for arrivals and departures. Arrived on easyjet (although they may be switching to Banesca which is altogether the poorer relation of the two airports serving Bucharest). Bussed to the terminal from the aircraft and immigration was swift as was baggage retrieval. Once outside I recommend you press on through the throng of taxi touts and either take the bus into town or a grab Fly Taxi cab and they will be at the head of the rank where their supervisor will get you organized. The meter only ticks when you are moving which is just as well as traffic can be heavy. There are cheaper and just as honest taxis but they either have to be phoned for or you need to seek them out at arrivals. Departing was a breeze security was pleasant but extremely thorough. Once through the formalities the shops are outrageously expensive compared to down town and whilst prices are displayed in euro local lei are readily accepted in the handful of cafes. Overall Otopeni is a small not very busy and clean facility surrounded by acres of apron and runway.A surprisingly good airport in terms of efficiency. While check-in is becoming a bit more chaotic and takes longer due to increased traffic it still has one of the quickest check-in times for an airport in Europe. Arrivals are usually a breeze. I think the longest I\\'ve had to wait at passport control is 5 minutes and the longest for baggage 15 minutes. The building and services are in need of an upgrade but that\\'s OK with me since it\\'s easy to spend a minimum amount of time at the airport.Overall a clean airport transfer from domestic to international flights very quick and bus connection very convenient. Airport personnel not smiling customs officers rude and do not speak English still not used to accept EEA/EU ID Cards and mix them up with other non-EU nationalities compared to Sofia Airport customs for example. A big smile is needed even if you are a customs airport officer to leave the country with a good impression.Modern but quite small airport. Security and baggage efficient and quite quick. Travel between airport and city is horrendously slow - the road just can\\'t handle the weekday traffic volume.A rather small but clean new airport with modern facilities a good business lounge. Quite a number of shops which I didn\\'t useBucharest airport serves it\\'s purpose but it\\'s nothing too exciting. Food outlets are very limited and overpriced there are also some overpriced shops in the departures area. It is a fairly small airport so moving through the airport is quick and easy. Transfers between Bucharest City and the This airport take about 20 - 45 mins. There are 2 methods of public transport between the city and airport. A bus which takes 40mins to 1 hour or a taxi which will cost about £3.00 - £6.00 or £8.00 if you get ripped off. Fly taxi is the only taxi company allowed to take passengers from the airport and their taxis charge twice the rate of the other taxi companies. I felt that it was worth me taking the time to provide this piece of information as there has been nothing written since last September so I hope that it is published and useful to others.This is now a good clean modern and efficient airport - a pleasant surprise. When recently departing the airport seemed almost deserted so there is clearly room for a considerable increase in traffic. In short this could and should be a regional hub airport. In common with much of Eastern Europe smoking restrictions are less than in the West. I cannot comment on public transport access as I was collected by car. Traffic to/from the city centre can be busy (and some pretty erratic driving can be observed) so allow plenty of time.I\\'ve use the airport several times over the last 8 years and have found a great improvement in it service. it\\'s still not up to English standard but considering it past I feel it\\'s doing very well with most of the facilities are friendly accessible and comparable and better in price to ours in England. Prices may fluctuate but there no worse than the very very high prices we can pay in our country if we allow the airports to rip us off.The international airport at Otopeni has the international standard and is quite comfortable for a Romanian point of view. The building is clean and the ways are short as the airport is quite small. The weak points are the rude agents at the buffets in the departure hall and especially the rip-off taxi-drivers who wait for arriving passengers. It is recommended to hold the luggage firmly in the hands to avoid it getting loaded in the taxi faster than you can watch. Always negotiate the fare before entering/loading the taxi. Never pay more than 400.000 Romanian LEI (11 EURO) for Bucharest-City-Centre ! Normally they demand 600.000 LEI or even more. Avoid paying in Euro there are cash-dispensers and changing counters in the arrival hall. There is a good bus-link to the city (nr. 783) for only 10% of the taxi-price (37.000 LEI) that leaves every 30 minutes. Departure is downstairs in the arrival hall (no signs!) the stairs are close to the exits. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the bus in a nearly invisible shop-box outside of the building.'"
