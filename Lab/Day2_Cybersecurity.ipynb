              "'The airport is certainly tiny! Arriving there was good off the plane quick straight onto a connecting bus to Brussels. Staff at the information stand were helpful & spoke English. The outbound journey wasn\\'t as pleasant security was over zealous (having to remove belt watch etc) and very unfriendly. Didn\\'t bother using the \\'canteen\\' in the cupboard (departure lounge 1) and there was a big crush fighting fellow passengers to get on the aircraft. The toilets in the lounge were filthy stinking & graffitid. Having said that for a flight that cost about the same as a pizza it\\'s worth putting up with and I\\'d use it again.Small airports are generally intimate friendly and welcoming. Not so with Charleroi. It is dirty seriously overcrowded at peak times and facilities are terrible. Ryanair does a good job of running a base on these facilities mind. Links to Brussels are good but that\\'s really thanks to Ryanair themselves. Food is terrible and waiting areas are not so conducive to extended stays (extended being anything more than 15 minutes)Waited an hour in a corridor for baggage but ours was the only arrival in 3 hours. Waited 45 mins for the bus driver to let people on then he went off for a 30 min fag break which meant we missed the connecting train to Brussels we could have walked quicker to town centre. Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet. It was a relief when the exits opened and we all made a charge for our non pre-allocated seats. Cheap but not cheerful next time I will pay the extra and fly direct from Manchester to Brussels Zaventem.The previous comment is so off the mark it must have been written by one of the \"anti-Ryanair\" squad. Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their \"connectional\" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don\\'t ever take criticism - just offer a \"Gallic shrug\". A \"joined-up public transport service\" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don\\'t die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission\\'s latest investigation hasn\\'t scuppered the Ryanair operation by then. I have no connection with Charleroi Airport nor with Ryanair (the only flight operator).The airport resulbles a shack. A very bad cafe and unfriendly staff across the whole airport. I will never use this airport again. It is a nightmare even trying to get to this excuse of an airport. My advice to anybody thinking of using this airport use Brussels National insteade.This is an incredibly confusing airport. Check in was fine but the passage to the gates winds through poorly marked duty free stores. Security was also good but by the third time you have to ask yourself \"where to now?\" the frustration has built. If I had been in a hurry I would have become furious.Zaventem my home airport. Lots of nostalgic childhood memories because of the Sabena frequent flyer status of my father. Nowadays very nice check in lounge lots of good food drinking options Zaventem was and is Belgium\\'s number one airport. The luggage pick up is still too slow. Smoking lounges too overcrowded and too small. But despite this few minor negative points Zaventem is a good organised clean airport its still the number one hub in Europe.Brussels to Zurich - The first impression was a disorderly airport and long queues. Not a very appealing interior ill-planned layout of the airport makes you go up and down several times. Not many things to look for while waiting for the flight. This airport is clearly not at par with other European standard airports.I flew from BRU on a transatlantic flight to New York. I arrived well in time but the Airport security had a 2 hour waiting line at the passport check. This meant that I almost missed my flight which was extremely frustrating. I cannot comprehend why this Airport is so incompetent in one of its main duties. I recommend flying out of AMS or DUS.I\\'ve read some of the critical reviews on this site and while Brussels airport is not the best airport I know I believe things have got better lately. The frequency of trains to and from the airport has increased some trains are still the old shuttle trains from Brussels but others are the very reasonable longer distance trains running through Belgium. The roadworks close to the airport are over. But more roadworks could be planned. The departure hall can be crowded but some low cost flights are now handled in a separate extension of the departure hall making room in the rest of the airport. The Schengen gates used to be accessible via a long underground tunnel with lots of escalators. These have gone now: there is a new \\'connector\\' building that is much more pleasant to go to the A gates. The new shops toilets restaurants in the A gates area look nice some restaurants still close relatively early. The non-Schengen gates are less bright but the new connector building now also improves the transfer from A to C gates and vice-versa. On my last visit to the airport my luggage was on the luggage retrieval belt before I got there so zero wait. The arrival hall is still the low-ceiling area it used to be quite unwelcoming.1) Please stop continuously changing gates! On our most recent trip it was changed an unbelievable 5 times! 2) Invest in an adequate loudspeaker system. 3) The acoustic is from the dark ages. 4) Various areas are not covered by working loudspeakers. 5) Train the announcers to articulate to slow down. 6) Employ people with excellent foreign language skills or native speakers. 7) Install more info counters. 8) Learn from \"top\" airports.As long as I live I will never get a connecting flight from this airport again nightmare of a journey from Gates A to B if your on a tight connecting flight expect to be running around. Expect very poor signage and awful attitude from airport staff and officials.I am a regular visitor of Zaventem Airport unfortunately because it is one of the worst airports in Europe. Traffic to the airport is a nightmare. Narrow and always blocked by never ending roadworks. Trains to the airport are dirty and at least 40 year old wrecks and you pay an horrendous price. Ticket area for trains is small dirty and always full with people queuing for the one single open sales point. (Machines do not accept foreign cards or credit cards.) Luggage delivery takes an average of 1.5 hours (yes 1.5 hours) almost a world record. Waiting time for the passport control can be up to 2 hours. The non-Schengen shopping area is almost non-existent. -Cleanliness and overall the state of maintenance is very poor. My advise go to Paris CDG. From there 1h 12m TGV to Brussels. That\\'s much quicker as fighting yourself trough the Zaventem chaos.I had the bad luck to spend 3 hours at EBBR in the transfer area. My connection flight to England with Brussels Airlines was delayed 2hrs which was actually good because the ways from the arrival gate to the departure gate B30 was a nightmare of a walk. After passing through yet another security land and yet another passport check (Schengen my butt) I had to walk another few kilometres to the gate in order to wait there for my flight. Being used to rather posh German airports the overall appearance of this airport was: a bland megalomaniac hellhole of gigantic boredom with everything outdated. Endless corridors to the gates and ending with dirty and tasteless seats in the waiting areas not to mention the toilets. It\\'s like entering a 3rd-world country. If you are a smoker you\\'ll appreciate the extremely sparse smoking areas. Very few bistros (I actually saw only one) that close very soon in the evening and a saddening mass of saddening vending machines top off the overall horrible experience with that airport. If I can avoid passing though EBBR I\\'ll pay any amount of Euros to do so.Worst airport visited. Long line up for immigration and no indication at all first line up 30 minutes then an airport staff member told us that we were at the wrong line we had headed to another line for international passengers even longer we spent 1 hour and 15 minutes to get through the immigration which was my flight departure time. Air Canada staff were kindly waiting for us at the last minute.I will never book a trip with Brussels airport as the transfer point. While the airport facilities were good transferring from hall A to Hall B is a disaster. We were leaving Europe and it is necessary to line up for passport review. There was a line 150 feet long about 200 people and they only have 2 stations to serve you. Serve is the wrong word it took 40 minutes to get through this point. The two staff were rude. They have very poor signage and it turned out that one line was for Euro Zone residents and the other for non Euro people. People were crowded into lines trying to get to the front only to be told they were in the wrong one. People were complaining because they were going to miss their flights. It was chaos. Then to top it off this young Passport Control supervisor yells at everyone that if they don\\'t calm down he \"will close the border\"! The root problem is that this transfer area is only designed to have two kiosks. They can\\'t even put more staff on. The worst bottleneck design I have seen in my many years travelling.Having arrived from Montreal (YUL) after originally departing from Toronto (YYZ) and being about 03.00 by my body clock I found my way to passport control ok reasonable queue very nice officers and then off to Duty Free before connecting to Bristol (BRS). Arriving in the non-Schengen zone my connection was also in the same zone so I headed off to the desk for the connection on my ticket. A quick trip through fast track security and off to the gate. Seems that I missed that flight and the desk agent ran off to do something or other to get me moving. She returned and handed me a new ticket for KLM to AMS. Back though passport control again no queue at all same nice officers and off to the other terminal. The ticket barcode access scanner for fast track security tells me to go to the original terminal and refuses to open so I just jump the rail and tell a security person on duty about the plane change who lets me through with no question. Second time through security scanning another passport stamp (3 in 1 hour) and off to the gate. Agent says to me with a dirty look that she was looking for me hours ago. Explained the changes and delays she turned pleasant checked me in and hit my seat with moments to spare. All in all it was a bit of a crazy time but it worked out and I had no real issues with any staff clerks officers at all. Will be back at BRU again next June when I\\'ll have a one day stop-over to properly suss out the airport. But until then I give it a Recommended rating.Awful possibly the worst transfer I\\'ve ever done. B gates are very old and shabby and involve a huge walk from the A terminal. Had to go through baggage claim and security again despite only travelling between Portugal and the UK on a connecting code share flight. Also had to argue for quite some time to allow my duty free to travel through security. Final insult was that my connecting flight was heavily delayed with very little information and the bars all closed at 7.30 despite there being a World Cup on and flights still leaving up to 11. Terrible experience will avoid like the plague.I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess. While everyone is waiting for his luggage you may have to collect more revenue from parking.Worst airport I have ever been in after 60 years of travelling all over the world. There was incorrect labelling of connections and we were sent in the wrong direction by an airport staff member who was directing passengers. This caused us to miss a very tight connection. Security was so offensive.Using Brussels airport for transit was a nightmare this morning. All transit passengers have to go through long queues for passport control and security which led the flight delay overunning outgoing flight time. This was delayed luckily - but passenger announcements were not made to let those involved know. Just that the last call had been made. The distance between the incoming gates and outgoing gates is truly enormous - but why when we were put on a bus to drive a further few kms to get to the aircraft? Why not have bus after a short walk if it has to go that far? Why were the Security staff telling us to go back to the check in desk to get another flight (and have to go through Passport Control and Security again) without first checking if the flight was being held (which they did at the second attempt)? Finally on arrival at destination - no baggage - it is still a Brussels. I will not try these routes again.29 July 2013. Worst Airport in Europe. Had to fly out of here on busy day. Allowed 3 hours. Small signs. Rude personnel apart from check-in man who was good. Tax refund department quote \"this is not my regular job\" as he dropped forms (losing 2 permanently) and shuffled papers. Huge queues. Unable to process English tax forms at Travelex in Brussels Airport. Poor duty free. Limited calls for airline lucky to reach airline on last call despite allowing 3 hours for check in.Missed connecting flight due to huge backlog in passport customs control. In addition to this did not receive luggage to and from destination due to baggage handlers work to rule strike. Too much ground to cover when making a connecting flight.Having to go from section A to B entails having to go through security and passport control and the distance is very long. This would not be an issue if there was plenty of time between flights. The 3 factors combined distance + passport control + security resulted in my being bumped of the flight as the airline thought 30 mins was not enough time to get from sector A to B. Then there is the baggage handlers strike which has added fuel to fire on the return. We have not heard from Swissport who handlers baggage on the status of the strike. The website does not recognize the airline tag when you try and get the status of your baggage. Almost a week later and no one has bothered to contact the passengers either by email or by phone. We had to wait 2 hours to get file our lost luggage claim in Paris. I lost money for the pre-paid taxi as a result which Swissport said they would not pay. So all in all I would not recommend flying through Brussels airport.This is my local airport which I use regularly. Easy access and plentiful parking. Spacious clean and easy to navigate terminals. Queues through security now shorter than previously. Good selection of shops and restaurants/cafes in the Schengen terminal. Major negative for me is the interminable time it takes to retrieve gold clubs on arrival and often having to \"go looking\" for them. Probably the worst airport I have experienced on this point.Transited through BRU en-route to ORD. The airport is nice and clean though dated. Did not look flashy like O\\'Hare. Staff are helpful. Quiet understated airport. The cafe was nice and selection of food excellent. Not crowded like many other Airports in Europe but duty free selection is nice. This is a good airport for transiting. Not a madhouse like LHR. Was bussed to the waiting Sabena plane.Having travelled around the world I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport which happens to be my home airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Many times the plane cannot get to the gate because ground staff are not present so we have to wait. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess with several planes on 1 carrousel and the next carrousel empty. Cleanliness is so poor the restrooms smell and are dirty the waiting seats are dirty.The airport does what it needs to do but no more. Access - by bus in/out: long waiting outside overloaded no space for baggage connecting with public transport requires carrying luggage down on crowded narrow stairs - very uncomfortable! By train: in house sometimes very dirty trains no space for baggage - more comfortable better access to the public transport system. Taxis are comfortable but hard to find at first time. Inside walking distances - Prepare yourself for long walks changing levels 3 times up and down on escalators and a huge queue in front of the security screening area in the evenings. Plan 60 mins to arrive at the boarding gate as net fast walk time exceeds 20 mins and wait time at the screening can take 30 mins. Toilets - There are many toilets they are easy to find. There are no toilets in the lounges. Flight information - There is usually no gate information on the screens until -30 of departure but it will be printed on the boarding pass at check-in. WIFI is available but expensive. Restaurants are good but expensive. Lounges are overloaded with people in the evening. The food is far below average. Boarding goes smoothly and usually directly from the terminal over a gangway. Baggage claim - Expect your luggage to be late. Overall nothing is horrible but it\\'s a quite uncomfortable airport for European standards.I used the airport in October 2012. Since it was a morning flight I arrived at the airport by the first train! Had plenty of time to explore the airport. Check in with SN Brussels airlines bound to Milan was smooth. Security control also fast enough. The immigration agent friendly. Found the airport fairly passenger friendly easy to find way out with good signage everywhere.Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminalsI arrived from Warsaw in the evening on 12th September. The airport was having peak hours with many arrivals and departures at the same time. However it was easy to navigate around the airport due to clear and good signages. It was a long walk from the aircraft however luggage was on the belt when we arrived at the luggage claim area. The train service to and from the airport was good where I was in the city less than 90 minutes from the time we landed.Used this airport on the 4th of August for my trip to Bangkok via Istanbul. The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff. At terminal B there were a lots of shops after passport control and before security. And after security there was also a bar and Duty Free shop.Landed tonight one of the last flights. Waited for 30 minutes for a gate agent to get the jetway so we could leave the plane. You may as well fly to Antwerp and walk to Brussels given how far Terminal A is from the exit. You\\'d think they would have put in a train or shuttle. Nope. Why do something that would add to the customer experience? Never check your bags at BRU or you will be over an hour before you get out. In short the ground staff are next to useless the design of the terminals is daft and often requires a hiking expedition to get to your flight and the customer service is often profoundly rude bordering on incompetent.Security queues can be long here at busy times with only some of the lines open. Apart from that its an efficient airport except that the distances involves can be large. Be especially careful if you are transferring from the A gates to B gates as the distance between is long (I would allow 45 mins just to get from one gate to the other).In the summer I wrote a review criticising two aspect of Brussels airportHorrible airport long queues no signs telling you where to go. The toilet facilities are quite bad. I was in the passport-queue for 45 minutes. I had quite a lot of hand luggage and I couldn\\'t find a single hand luggage cart! To top it all you have to pay for the liquid gel bags? Very inefficient and hostile airport.This is one of the most inefficient airports. This airport is not really adapted for internal European flights. For a 1 hr flight you need to walk at least 15 minutes before having a chance to reach the exit and if by misfortune you had checked in bags then you won\\'t be out of the airport in less than 30 mins minimum.DEL-BRU-GVA. Arrived on a Jet airways flight. Landed at T-B onward connection to Geneva from T-1 Brussels Airlines. I am a Swiss Citizens so didn\\'t have to go through the non-EU passport control long queue. Got to the Security check and as expected long queue there. Finally boarded my flight to Geneva with few minutes to spare. I can assure you that if I was a non-EU citizen my flight would have left.Although it\\'s becoming an important European hub Zaventem airport still keep a \"human\" size and moving between and within terminals is quite easy. Organized efficiently there are a lot of shopping and eating options lounges are well located and lines in migration customs and security-checks run efficiently. Staff overall are friendly.BRU is easy to get around and walking distances were short. Luggage took a bit longer to be unloaded on arrival but otherwise no complaints. We arrived at about 7.30 am for our return flight to Canada and virtually skipped through security. One negative at least as far as I could see - on arrival at the airport we were looking forward to a relaxed breakfast before our flight however there were no sit down restaurants within sight of our departure gate.This airport gives me a nice home-feel not too big and overcrowded and yet all the services one needs (shops lounges). Security lines can be long at rush hour but not exaggerated.Pleasant airport lots of shops and restaurants bit overpriced. Lounges are too small always overcrowded. Airport is clean but not spotless (room for improvement) and you need to walk a lot to get to your gate. The A terminal is 1km in length and it takes about 15min to get there from the main entrance building. The luggage control is over crowded too.BRU is quite inefficient. The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault. However the long walks and 20mins for security check definitely are. Strong advice - please arrive at this airport at least 2hrs prior to departure esp if flying Brussels airlines.I have used Brussels 4-6 times a year for about 20 years. Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient. As usual there were two sales points open and queues stretched out of the booking hall.Has no electricity connectors foreseen for visitors of other countries. Waiting on your luggage becomes longer and longer every month. In the beginning luggage took around 15mins to claim now you have to wait around 45-60 mins.Well organized airport with GOOD security checks. Queues are well organized processing is speedy with helpful attendants. Good selection of shops and food-outlets once you are through security. Restaurants fairly priced and courteous staff. Good selection of authentic Belgian products at competitive prices.Flew several times to/from BRU. Generally positive experience. Last time efficient check-in quick passport and smooth security (though it wasn\\'t anything near rush hour). The walk to the gate saves you time in a gymI use Brussels Airport every time so on average 20 times a year. It\\'s very easy to reach by public transport and by car (there were some rush hour queues when the infrastructure was being rebuilt but that\\'s finished now) very difficult to find a parking space close to the terminal on busy days. Kiss and ride zone works very efficiently when Police are patrolling without Police it\\'s chaos because people leave their car parked. In 90% of the times never had to wait more than 30 minutes for checking in (I don\\'t bother checking in online or using the machines) Staff is usually very friendly and they know multiple languages. Security can be really bad on some days so expect long queues. Again in about 80% of the time got through in less than half an hour. Terminal A is modern very spacious and very nice to be in but about 15 minutes of walking from the check-in area. Terminal B is older but does not look aged less shops and less seating. Baggage drop off was very efficient my luggage would be waiting on the belt but that\\'s changed after some worker strikes. Expect 20-30 minutes of wait (when you arrive at the belt which is also about 20 minutes after arrival at the gate).Transited BRU earlier this month. Total chaos. Landed from MXP in terminal B long walk to terminal A for connecting flight to PHL. Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate. Very little to look at air side no food nor shopping this was mainly pre security as was duty free kiosk so could not get that stamped forfeiting the refund. Not the best experience.I have never had a good experience at Brussels Airport. Travelling to Africa via Brussels makes you feel like a third class citizen (whatever your skin colour). You are almost forced into using a transfer bus from a virtually unheated part of the airport. If you can find another way to Africa that does not involve passing through Brussels take it.Flew from the UK to Oslo via Brussels Airport return. Signage and directions were extremely confusing and the security staff were rude and arrogant. I don\\'t know how old the Airport is but the facilities were dated and unclean.Clean easy to access at low price from city centre by train. Confusing in the check-in zone but once you pass security fantastic shopping plenty of space to sit good indications and long distances so enough time is needed to join the flights to Africa.BOM-BRU-CDG. Transit through BRU on Jet Airways. Landed at 0750 at concourse B with onward flight to CDG at 0940 from concourse A. After a long walk through concourse B reached passport control. 4 counters operating for non EU citizens with more than 200 people in line. Took an agonizing 1 hour and 10 min to clear. Again a long walk to reach concourse A. Security check took another 10 min. Had to rush to my gate to avoid missing the flight and reached just 2 minutes before scheduled departure time. No clear or enough directions to reach the gates. I guess the airlines are used to it and they waited for an additional 15-20 minutes for passengers who were stuck in the BRU maze. Please avoid transiting through BRU if you can or allow at least 3 hours to transit.Access to and from the airport is easy by car or rail. If you arrive too early for check in there is no seating so either be prepared to stand or come a bit later. Security checks can be tiring - depending of course on how many people are waiting in line. Was not required to take off shoes since they have a new machine that you simply stand on. I was however required to take off my belt and every once in about three times I used this airport was body searched as well. Once you go through all the hassle it gets more calm there is usually enough seating and the waiting is OK. All in all a clean and efficient airport. The only really bother: you may have a very long walk from arrival gate to passport control since the terminal is a long corridor. If you\\'re lucky you will land closer to the terminal.I used to like travelling through Brussels Airport : not anymore ! The few last month the airport experience has turned from pleasant to very anoying due to the lack of staff . Lack of staff at check in with Brussels airlines : the airline is trying to force everybody to check on line and the result is long queues at the airport. Lack of staff at boarding pass control : another line before getting to the terminal. Lack of staff at security where now you have to take off shoes every time with rude and bored staff and queues getting longer each month. Altogether a very bad experience and no time left to spend some time and money in the shops.Cool modern design and lots of space to sit. I arrived in BRU too early and thus had a long wait for my flight and found you have to pay for the wireless internet. No entertainment thus. The free charging stations for your laptop/cell phone were useful though. Toilets clean (despite someone had been smoking in there). What I really found annoying was the journey to the luggage claim up and down escalators and long corridors. I also didn\\'t realize the exit was in the middle of the luggage claim area and not in the end and thus wandered around looking a bit lost. There was also no mailbox after the security check - I forgot to mail my postcards before going in. The maps claimed there should\\'ve been one but I really couldn\\'t find it. Rail connection to Brussels ok railway station sterile and boring.Good airport I have used it a few times nice and clean. Never really had the chance to check duty free though. But be prepared to walk and I mean really walk 3 floors down and then under the park bays (?) and 3 floors up. The designer should have been a health freak.. the last thing I want when rushing to meetings is a 20 minute jog to exit an airport!Terminal A is a dreadful place where one can easily got lost. When arriving there\\'s an endless walk to the exit with escalators up and down and miles of moving walkways with few and confusing signs in this shopping of an airport. Finding the train station is quite a challenge too. The automatic tickets vending machines only accept Belgium cards. On the positive side it\\'s a clean place full of natural light but designed by someone who never use airports!Nice airport but they do love their escalators don\\'t they? There is one after another to go anywhere. It is almost comical. I had heard about this but seeing it in person made me laugh. Grab a piece of chocolate to keep your energy up!Terminal A for Schengen flights is quite comfortable with much natural daylight and plenty of seating areas. But it is quite a long walk to the baggage claim area using numerous escalators. Catering is good and reasonably priced. Trains to downtown Brussels run every 20min and are cheap. Please note that the ticket vending machines accept Euro coins only and no credit cards. Signals in the check-in halls could be improved as it is rather difficult to locate the right counter.Very long queues for security tonight in zone B in Brussels. At least a 400m queue to reach the scanners it started just after the passport check desks and it was slow moving. This did not seem to have any obvious cause. With the mega long walks you can have here a good reason to be prudent.Brussels Airport is convenient and most of the time easy to travel through. Bright and airy the Shengen terminal is much better than the older one and also offers more opportunities for shopping. Recently longs queues for security have appeared and the airport management should find a solution to this problem.BRU Zaventem Airport has made significant improvements over the last couple of years. I was in and out of this airport almost monthly for 4 years and despite most often using the rather old B concourse they have not only built additional gates but also invested in some upgrades. Arrival is still a bit odd with long walks from gate to immigration counters in concourse B and with sometimes long queues. However airport staff is friendly and security is strict but done in a friendly manner. Overall a 3 to 4 stars in Europe. With improved intercontinental connections and one of the best intra-Europe network this airport has good potential to become even better and more attractive to travellers.I use Brussels airport a lot and it is a good airport which has got better over the past couple of years. The cafes are good and not too expensive when compared with places like Heathrow. The train service should be improved though as it only accepts Belgian debit cards and normally only 1 machine works. As everyone is coming from abroad this doesn\\'t make much sense.A well run and well maintained airport with friendly and efficient staff. Frequent and reasonably priced train link into central Brussels. Didn\\'t use the shops or catering so can\\'t comment there. If your flight comes in at the far end of pier A then you\\'re in for quite a hike to the train station/taxi pick up and the signing seems to fizzle out towards the end but otherwise a very good experience.The negative aspects are high prices in restaurants and car parking. Although there is a single terminal there are two departure areas - \"A\" for Schengen zone countries (i.e. no passport controls) and \"B\" for non-Schengen (including the UK and Ireland). Passengers travelling through area \"B\" have a far shorter walk to/from the \\'planes. Flights occasionally arrive at area \"A\" from non-Schengen countries - this is usually when bus transfers are necessary (so that passengers have to pass through passport control). A good recent development are the direct trains from the airport to Leuven as well as Brussels. A little known bus link is the hourly De Lijn service 359 to/from Roodebeek Metro station - useful for the east side of Brussels.Zaventem is good clean and friendly. The food is pricey. The train connection is excellent but the taxis are a crude rip off. We are stuck with the never-ending tunnel to terminal A but the terminal is nice when you get there. Do something about people parking on the forecourt. And bussing when you land is hateful time consuming and stressful.Improvement in cleanliness and staff. Smooth process for drop-off, security, frontier and boarding, fast baggage on belt at return. Smokers friendly airport. The food/ drinks in restaurants are expensive for Romanian standards, at least. Nearly missed my plane, in spite of arriving at airport in good time. One of two Security Gates has to be chosen according to designated Departure Gate, but latter is not shown on screen in Departures Hall. Security itself was chaotic. I was ordered into a queue which took more than twenty-five minutes just to reach the scanning equipment (one man was observing two scanners at once). After my laptop was scanned, I was told to start it up and then turn it off, meaning even more time was lost. Passport control was slow: in total it took more than thirty-five minutes between entering security and entering the departure lounge, by which time my flight was closing.We transferred from a TAROM flight to KLM and our experience was smooth. The facilities airside are two folded the last part of the pier with our boarding gate (12) was looking nice and modern the first part looked bit shabby and worn down seen the economic reality in Romania it was high standard. I can\\'t make any statement about the landside but the transfer security was lacking proper English skills and it was hard to communicate and get what they wanted which gives you the impression that these people are rude. In fact they aren\\'t if you look into their body language as well.The worst airport I have been to. Early morning flight and airport was very busy. Several kiosks were not working and only one person there to help. She was very rude and not trying to help. Everyone kept telling us to go to someone else for help with boarding pass but could never talk to anyone. No one seemed to care that a large group of us were having a problem getting boarding passes. Lines for security were chaos. No one directing people and everyone just pushing in together. Terrible experience.Quick friendly security screening. Short lines at passport control. However smoking areas not well controlled and was forced to breathe second hand smoke for 40 minutes sitting at my gate waiting to board my flight. I travel a lot and this is the only airport in the 15 or so years where I have ever experienced this.A good airport. Very quickly through security which was staffed by polite people. Passport control queues small and staff dealt with all nationalities in a polite manner. Signs throughout the airport were found to be well positioned and also displayed in English. Over-all this a good airport.Excellent airport very large friendly staff beats airports in France or Italy.In general it is a normal airport. There are some shops places to sit etc. bathrooms are relatively clean. However I faced huge issues when I had to use the parking facilities. There is no gratis period for a car to come in and just pick you up for a very short period. This is very inappropriate because afterwards the only way to pay is in the local currency. EUR is not accepted anywhere and the exchange rates are very unfavorable. Moreover they did not accept to exchange small money (in my case 10 EUR). This caused a huge inconvenience for me and I have to say that the staff was not friendly either. I am definitely not keen on coming to this airport again!It was not particularly busy when I arrived and departed but I felt Bucharest was one of the best airport experiences I have had in years. Apart from a short wait to check-in there were no queues anywhere and staff were courteous and friendly throughout. There is plentiful seating and a range of different food outlets (admittedly many selling similar food) and shops. A cheap alternative to a taxi is to use the bus into the city about every 20 minutes and a return ticket costs about 2 euros.We started coming through here in December 2000. It\\'s gone a long ways to finish what they started in the last 13 years but obviously by the other reviews still have a long ways to go in the pre-security departure lounge. However Lavazza is a nice touch because unlike the Starbucks model in which you have to help yourself and clean up your own mess the Lavazza is fastidiously serviced by wait staff who are very polite and attentive.All the people I encountered in this Airport were friendly. It\\'s not what I would say in the league of Singapore\\'s Changi but nevertheless functional in design. Anyone though who has to spend more than 2 hours in the airport would be surely bored. Dining facilities are poor with the same saturated fat selection\\'s. Taxi Fare to the airport from Bucharest Centre should be no more than 30 Leu. Avoid the taxi louts in arrivals or anyone who approaches offering this and that as you would anywhere. They will cost you a small fortune.OTP in fact is two airports in one. The check-in hall the security controls and the passport control areas are old overcrowded messy and do not meet European standards. Once surviving this the departure hall is new and nice with many shops and bars. Especially in the morning it is suggested to arrive pretty early in order to get through the x-ray and passport controls: the queue is totally unorganized time consuming and stressful.Transferred in Bucharest coming from Paris to Oradea. OTP is a small airport quite modern. The issue is that I landed \"International\" in the new terminal had to walk (in a hurry because my transfer was tight) to the old domestic terminal to get my boarding card to find that the door was in fact at the new international terminal and walk back all the way! As there was only 1 line of luggage/passengers inspection open and not very fast that was really limit and I was lucky to board the bus on time. On the way back had some time to spend and could have a nice espresso and pastry in one of the bars. The international terminal is modern and clean but do not expect the facilities and free-tax of Singapore this is just a \"regional\" airport.Well having recently traveled through Henri Coanda airport I found that there is not much before you go through security but when you are there is quite a few shops although for some unknown reason in duty free they will not accept the local currency which is the first airport I have come across that does not. In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks. When in the queue a passport control officer paid for his drink with no problem and when I mentioned it he was so rude but as I was going to go through to depart what can I say would I use this restaurant again definitely not. Would I return to Bucharest again probably not.The usual mix of rude staff expensive food and poor signage. Not enough shops for a capital city airport.One of the best small airports in Europe. You get in and out quickly and the addition of the new terminal still keeps it efficient. Staff are not overly friendly. Lines are short and there may not be a lot to do but that\\'s fine since you never spend long here. Traffic to the centre is much improved but watch out for the taxi touts outside baggage claim.I travel regularly to Bucharest and have been impressed by improvements made to this airport. It is clean directions are well signposted. If you use public transport it is cheap to travel into the City Centre by train or bus. The airport taxis are ok but watch out for taxi touts. To date I have had no problems with luggage on any of my trips through this airport and have had only friendly and efficient treatment by check-in and other staff. Coffee is expensive in the coffee bars though there are some coffee machines . Most facilities can be found here and security is clearly on view.I was positively surprised by the changes that occurred in Henri Coanda Airport in Bucharest. Now it has a new terminal over 40 gates I believe and the duty free is actually open and it works. It still does not accept payment in Romanian Lei (only $US and Euros and potentially credit cards). It does look like a nice airport terminal now once you do the check-in. Before check-in it\\'s still outdated.I connected through OTP from Istanbul to Venice on TAROM. After disembarking all our plane\\'s passengers were made to wait in a hallway unable to enter the main terminal for about half an hour. The guard in charge clearly did not know what to do with anyone. At length someone else showed up and simply opened a door letting everyone enter the terminal not requiring any documents. The gate for our connecting flight to Venice was changed several times -- each time with no notice. The only way passengers knew there had been a change was if they happened to look at the departure board and saw that the gate was different. I found OTP to be decades behind the rest of the world.Arrival at Bucharest Baneasa awful experience. Building is too small to accommodate all arriving passengers. Departures are even worse shady unorganized looking terminal. Security check takes forever and is an inefficient process. Waiting area at the gates too small too accommodate passengers of one flight let alone if 2 flights leave at about the same time.Arrived from Paris to Bucharest OTP. The Tarom plane was allowed direct access. Quite a long walk until you get to the passport control that went quick with Police Officers that have improved a lot since the past days. We were waiting at belt 1 for the luggage as shown on the screen when somebody noticed that our flight was no longer on this screen ! It had been moved to an other belt without notice. 2 days later flew from OTP to Cluj (internal flight) - check- in was quick and efficient waiting-room much too small with not enough seats boarding by bus. All in all not HKG or Singapore but better than some other European airports.I was impressed by the speed of immigration on arrival and received a nice welcome from the officer checking my passport. Customs ignored me and I was out in less than 8 minutes in total. The bus journey into the city centre was -as everyone says- a nightmare. The only way to avoid it is to arrive late in the evening and take a taxi. The departure was different. There does not seem to be room for a queue and if you don\\'t speak Romanian it can be hard to check if you are in the correct queue. Nevertheless it was all fairly friendly and I have seen worse at Heathrow!Although it\\'s only about 10 miles away from Bucharest traffic to and from the airport is a nightmare: depending on the time of day it takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to get there (also beware of incredible rip-offs with the taxisImmigration quickly cleared and baggage quickly appeared. Travel into the city is a nightmare - the road network is wholly inadequate for a developing city. Check in for returning flight was quick with no queue but then very long wait at security probably due to heightened measures ahead of the NATO summit. Departure lounge comfortable if slightly basic but all outlets food and non-food very expensive. Range of food on offer very restricted - OK for a snack but not more (even if you could afford it). All outlets will accept EUR but do not seem to have change.There are separate buildings for arrivals and departures. Arrived on easyjet (although they may be switching to Banesca which is altogether the poorer relation of the two airports serving Bucharest). Bussed to the terminal from the aircraft and immigration was swift as was baggage retrieval. Once outside I recommend you press on through the throng of taxi touts and either take the bus into town or a grab Fly Taxi cab and they will be at the head of the rank where their supervisor will get you organized. The meter only ticks when you are moving which is just as well as traffic can be heavy. There are cheaper and just as honest taxis but they either have to be phoned for or you need to seek them out at arrivals. Departing was a breeze security was pleasant but extremely thorough. Once through the formalities the shops are outrageously expensive compared to down town and whilst prices are displayed in euro local lei are readily accepted in the handful of cafes. Overall Otopeni is a small not very busy and clean facility surrounded by acres of apron and runway.A surprisingly good airport in terms of efficiency. While check-in is becoming a bit more chaotic and takes longer due to increased traffic it still has one of the quickest check-in times for an airport in Europe. Arrivals are usually a breeze. I think the longest I\\'ve had to wait at passport control is 5 minutes and the longest for baggage 15 minutes. The building and services are in need of an upgrade but that\\'s OK with me since it\\'s easy to spend a minimum amount of time at the airport.Overall a clean airport transfer from domestic to international flights very quick and bus connection very convenient. Airport personnel not smiling customs officers rude and do not speak English still not used to accept EEA/EU ID Cards and mix them up with other non-EU nationalities compared to Sofia Airport customs for example. A big smile is needed even if you are a customs airport officer to leave the country with a good impression.Modern but quite small airport. Security and baggage efficient and quite quick. Travel between airport and city is horrendously slow - the road just can\\'t handle the weekday traffic volume.A rather small but clean new airport with modern facilities a good business lounge. Quite a number of shops which I didn\\'t useBucharest airport serves it\\'s purpose but it\\'s nothing too exciting. Food outlets are very limited and overpriced there are also some overpriced shops in the departures area. It is a fairly small airport so moving through the airport is quick and easy. Transfers between Bucharest City and the This airport take about 20 - 45 mins. There are 2 methods of public transport between the city and airport. A bus which takes 40mins to 1 hour or a taxi which will cost about £3.00 - £6.00 or £8.00 if you get ripped off. Fly taxi is the only taxi company allowed to take passengers from the airport and their taxis charge twice the rate of the other taxi companies. I felt that it was worth me taking the time to provide this piece of information as there has been nothing written since last September so I hope that it is published and useful to others.This is now a good clean modern and efficient airport - a pleasant surprise. When recently departing the airport seemed almost deserted so there is clearly room for a considerable increase in traffic. In short this could and should be a regional hub airport. In common with much of Eastern Europe smoking restrictions are less than in the West. I cannot comment on public transport access as I was collected by car. Traffic to/from the city centre can be busy (and some pretty erratic driving can be observed) so allow plenty of time.I\\'ve use the airport several times over the last 8 years and have found a great improvement in it service. it\\'s still not up to English standard but considering it past I feel it\\'s doing very well with most of the facilities are friendly accessible and comparable and better in price to ours in England. Prices may fluctuate but there no worse than the very very high prices we can pay in our country if we allow the airports to rip us off.The international airport at Otopeni has the international standard and is quite comfortable for a Romanian point of view. The building is clean and the ways are short as the airport is quite small. The weak points are the rude agents at the buffets in the departure hall and especially the rip-off taxi-drivers who wait for arriving passengers. It is recommended to hold the luggage firmly in the hands to avoid it getting loaded in the taxi faster than you can watch. Always negotiate the fare before entering/loading the taxi. Never pay more than 400.000 Romanian LEI (11 EURO) for Bucharest-City-Centre ! Normally they demand 600.000 LEI or even more. Avoid paying in Euro there are cash-dispensers and changing counters in the arrival hall. There is a good bus-link to the city (nr. 783) for only 10% of the taxi-price (37.000 LEI) that leaves every 30 minutes. Departure is downstairs in the arrival hall (no signs!) the stairs are close to the exits. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the bus in a nearly invisible shop-box outside of the building.Arriving at the airport at 4 a.m., we entered to check in, check our baggage. We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn\\'t know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow. Going through we reach the area to access departure gates. Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing. Airport managers must only live and work on the airside, never seeing the hassle passengers must go through. Best way to see the Budapest airport is from your plane\\'s window as you fly out to the modern world.Flying in was fantastic quickly through passport control but had to wait 50 minutes for our baggage. Terminal 2B is modern efficient and has great facilities. Oh how I miss T1 with its old world charm. Flying out was strenuous and a long process. Although we had checked in online we still had to queue for over an hour to get our bags checked leaving very little time to go through the ergonomically bad security again after a long wait. Still as typically Hungarian all staff are extremely polite and helpful. It was the amount of times we had to present our travel documents that become irritating. Hopefully the next time I fly into Ferihegy I will be staying in Hungary permanently.Ferighegy Airport is a quite efficient clearly signed airport. On our arrival from Amsterdam we were directed to an escalator about 25 meters away from our arrival gate and within 20 minutes we were out of the airport and on our way to our Hotel. Seamless experience there. Leaving Budapest towards Bucharest with TAROM was a smooth experience as well the SkyPriority counters were completely free and we were checked in in a matter of minutes. As they were very strict with the FastTrack we chose for the standard lane as my wife has no Priority status and we did not want to separate there but the queue on this busy 8am was short and efficient and within a small 8-10 minutes we were security cleared. Another few steps in the terminal to the non-schengen departures which were deserted at the time of our departure. The boarding process via the bus (it was a small commuter plane) was less orderly there was a priority section in the bus but which was not enforced so the run to the plane was opened as soon as the bus opened it\\'s doors. Further up for the smoker the cigarette prices are highly competitive and you can take two cartons when travelling within the EU per person.Everything seemed to run pretty smoothly here and baggage arrived quickly. The handlers were quite efficient at getting missing bag to me after it arrived on the next flight. Departing there was about a 20 min queue at the Lufthansa check in but security was quite quick.Travel here quite often. WIFI used to be unusable at all but things are progressing. The queueing is usually fast but you bet your shoes or only metal glasses will beep - most sensitive metal detector on earth. Personnel generally not pleasant given by culture. Forgot phone once on board nobody bothered much to help me and nobody ever called back despite they promised etc. From service point still lot to learn.Great. Extremely clean facilities great food and great observation tower. The only minor blip was the queuing which took a while but its what I suspected would happen. Great airport would fly from there again.The airport terminal 2B is now comfortable and check in desks satisfactory. The worst thing is the long walk through a covered way but open to the elements so you can get soaked if wind and raining. You then have to stand for such a long time (once over an hour) in the \"cattle sheds\" which are baking hot in summer and your plane hasn\\'t even arrived at airport. Once in this shed there are no toilet facilities or any seating. Hopefully this situation will be improved in near future.When departing from here arrive 3+ hours before boarding - only one baggage wrapping point was available - we spent 30 minutes in the queue and could only pay by cash. No signage for the ATMs. Security lines were understaffed. There were only 4 safety lines working and it was very inconvenient to put on shoes after security check without a seat. Immigration was slow due to IT system problems. The rest of airport facilities we used like baggage drop-off overall air-conditioning cleanliness customs for tax refund the tax refund itself duty free shops were as expected. So in general the airport was rather a nervous disappointment - can do better.The airport is very small and cramped. Terminal 2 is divided in two parts making it really small and uncomfortable. Queues are huge both at check-in and security. If not for the Skycourt after security and the maze-like duty-free it would really be claustrophobic with the lack of daylight being a real nuisance. The link to the city is very poor. The bus / metro combination is both uncomfortable and expensive making it impossible for you to reach the city center without a transfer. The entire terminal has only one exchange booth but most appalling wasn\\'t their scarcity but the rate they\\'re charging which was nothing short of a scam - welcome to Europe. Coming from Ukraine (IEV) the contrast was even more evident. Toilets weren\\'t clean broken faucets soap lacking in many. Next - the Wi-Fi. BUD supposedly offers 2 hours of free Wi-Fi that is available once you get passed a lengthy security/rules agreement check-page that directs you then onto another useless page that given the speed takes ages to load. Even once passed those mandatory checkpoints the internet was still very slow and almost completely useless. Basically nothing good and I won\\'t be looking forward to going back to the airport in the future. If not for the occasional offers to some places unserved from Belgrade (such as Kiev) it\\'s really not worth the hassle.Worst airport in the world. No smoking area in an international airport? Come on! What a joke! Even better when your flight is delayed 4 hours and there is no possible way to exit and re enter the terminal. Ridiculous.The incoming flight (turn-around) was delayed by 1 hour due to technical problems and a replacement plane was used so our departure EasyJet flight (U28424) was also late to depart. This was an irritation but was not our main problem the problem was we were told on the electronic read outs that boarding had commenced only to walk a very long way to what was a metal out-building with no facilities no proper seating arrangement and as far as I could see no toilets and no air conditioning on a fairly hot day. We were forced to stand for some 30 minutes or more. The incoming flight had not touched down at this point. We stood there covered in sweat from the heat. As senior citizens we were not pleased with this arrangement. It was akin to herding cattle. This is the 21st century and Ferihegy were recently upgraded. Budapest Airport this should have been a better experience than this very poor! After complaining we received a well constructed (probably by a lawyer) standard letter more or less stating that this was the future low cost flying for keeping costs down for budget airlines. My interpretation is if you do not like it fly business class or at least book priority boarding. Not a good airport to fly budget anymore.A rather disappointing airport. A beautiful city like Budapest sure deserves better. Terrible queues at border control and check-in. Lack of good shops and restaurants. Too little ATMs and currency exchange points. The building itself is rather small with nothing else to do but to sit and wait for the flight. Granted there\\'s a free 120-min. Wi-Fi. The road to the airport is not a highway but a very narrow local route with lots of traffic lights and traffic jams on the way. With so many tourists coming in to Hungary they sure need to make significant improvements otherwise if the number of passengers increases dramatically the airport would be paralysed.Flew in and out by Ryanair. Bussed to the terminal on arrival had to walk a long way to an out station shed for departure. Terminal is clean and modern worked very efficiently and has free WIFI. public transport too and from the airport is very efficient and cheap. I was very impressed.I flew to and from this airport with Wizz air. After landing at Budapest we taxied to our remote parking spot. We where bussed towards the terminal. After going to the toilet (which was clean) I was really surprised to see my bag already on the luggage belt. When it was time to return we went to terminal 2B. We dropped the bag at the bag drop off counter. We walked to the security point. Everything went quickly and smoothly (approx. 10 min). The airport had a very nice food court and all looks very modern and clean. My overall impression of Budapest Airport was very good!Good infrastructure bad management and poorly trained staff. Check-in doesn\\'t open until exactly 2 hours before the flight (regardless of how empty the place is and/or how many passengers are waiting). Hand- luggage check is disorganized. All is over-sized and there is a lot of running around for nothing. Staff are too disinterested to change the lanes to fit the demand. Then there is the laughable shoes and belt off routine that has long been shown to be nonsense and abandoned by most airports. So overall keep the building get rid off the supervisors and start training the remaining employees.Never seen anything like this. Passengers hauled into a tent to wait for boarding like cattle. No heating no sanitation. Shame on these people. I have a couple ideas for further improvements/cost saving: passengers should load their baggage onto the plane or passengers should push the plane on the runway.This is an interesting airport to say the least. We flew out of terminal 2B and it seems as though they ran out of money to completely renovate the entire terminal. Once past security where the bin helpers throw your bins onto the conveyor belt with no regards to what hand luggage you might be carrying you come upon a beautifully renovated terminal with nice seating areas and a good selection of restaurants. There is free wifi in the food court area and the bathrooms are pretty clean. But then you go to the gate area and its like you are going back to the 1970s. Even worse my gate did not have a \"real\" gate. We had to walk outside and then we were corralled into a big tent with only four pathetic heating lights in the entire thing. It\\'s a real shame that the airport couldn\\'t do a complete renovation of the terminal because it looked like it had so much potential to be nice.Terminal 2 takes all flights but has no rail link to Budapest meaning a long bus ride or pricey taxi is the only way to get there. Arriving was fine apart from a ridiculously long queue at immigration despite us arriving from an EU nation. Return - Check in was alright a long queue but it seemed to go down quickly. Queuing at security was a shambles took longer to pass the tiny security hall than it did to check in. Duty Free was alright and the skycourt upstairs for food and drink is brilliant. I have a huge problem with the way they board aircraft\\'s here - boarding 3 Jet2 flights (Leeds Manchester Edinburgh) through the same gate at the same time? Was an absolute shambles. An hour before the flight was due to depart we were told we were boarding through the gate walked down the jetway onto the airport tarmac walked across and into what can only be described as a tent - with 3 queues for each flight. No toilet facilities and no seating just standing room only. Waited in a freezing cold damp tent for half an hour then the doors were opened and all 3 queues boarded 3 identical aircraft - what a shambles. People were boarding the wrong plane and because of it we left 30 minutes late but thankfully made up for it in flight. For the major international airport of a capital city of a European Country this was a shambles. I\\'ve flown to Greek Island airstrips and had a better experience.Terminal 1 closed in early 2012. T2 now takes all flights. It was refurbished last year and is spacious well organised and light. There are lots of good food options on the second floor. Shops are ok but overpriced. The main problem is accessibility as T2 is not served by a railway connection (unlike T1). There is a taxi service but it is a little pricey.Airport has good bus links to city but you need to change at the end of the bus line onto the metro to finish your final leg to the city. No train link direct from airport. Bureau de Change always very busy so advisable to get your holiday money before you leave. Airport signage was slightly confusing (does an up arrow mean straight ahead or on the floor above?) but not to the point it would seriously disrupt you. Airport terminal 2B was well lit modern and had excellent facilities. Staff understood English well. In security lines very fast moving metal rolling bars move the trays along be warned.Remember my stay here as smooth and a pleasure. Superb view of the airport from several spots which I appreciated. Ground crew put on viking helmets when the Norwegian Air Shuttle came in. Quite a small airport perhaps a bit too small which gives little options for food and other things you might want to purchase. Everything elseArrived late in the evening speed through border control didn\\'t have to wait for our luggage. But departed on BA from Terminal 2B what a disasterTerminal 1 is the designated low cost terminal catering for Wizzair easyjet Jet2 Germanwings and Norwegian. It is small but has been nicely refurbished and contains everything you could need as both an arriving or departing passenger. Plenty of refreshment outlets and even an outside viewing area overlooking the apron which is free to visit if you need to kill a bit of time while you wait for your flight. Overall a very nice experience.Arrived at Terminal 2. Bags arrived very quickly. Taxi service to the centre is well organised fixed price (depending on zone) and not expensive (and discount card for fixed price back to the airport). Check-in on departure is well-organised and efficient. Boarding cards issued online or by machine at airport (with someone to help with machines) - the desks only receive baggage. We checked in online to choose seats but did not complete because we did not have access to a printer. Got the boarding passes from the machine at the airport but with the seats we had chosen online. Very smart departure area. Paid to go in the Malev business lounge (EUR 16 each) which was well worth it.The No Entry or No Stop restriction at the arrival curbside of Ferihegy 1 and 2 airports is below any international standard of civilised travel. As a result arriving traffic has moved up to the 2A/2B Departure curbside making departure twice as congested as it should be. The overpriced parking lots are empty so are the overpriced taxis (parking without passengers) in the arrival area.Booked with Malev AMS-BUD-IST with a transfer time of 45 minutes far too short. A very long line-up to exit the EU with few customs officials impossible! Several people missed their connecting flight. Very frustrating and inefficient system. Officials unable to help those who were missing their connecting flights. Beware while traveling through BUD on a short transfer!Arrived at this airport from Amsterdam. I was in the city within 90 minutes from the time of arrival. Staff at information counter not friendly and not happy with the job she is doing. The public transportation from or to the city was average but worked fine. I bought the 72 hours travel card (works on metro trams and buses) from the airport\\'s post-office. The cheapest way to get to the city is by bus 200E from the arrival bay to the nearest metro station Station Kobanya-Kispest (M3) on the blue line. On the departure day at Terminal 2 Malev check-in agent and BUD\\'s KLM staff were both polite and helpful. From check-in counter until clearing the security check point took less than 15 minutes although the airport had a busy period in the afternoon. Did not make any buying at the duty-free outlet due to tight waiting time for my departure. The airport seems clean. The only complaint is the airport has insufficient seating at departure area.Terminal 2 for transferring. Nice and clean airport. Because of change between Schengen and non-Schengen area a brisk walk from one wing of the terminal to another but not really a problem after just sitting in the airplane. Going out from Schengen there is no safety check coming inside there is. Restrooms a bit hard to find.Very new and bright at departure area but the arrival area is really dark and dated. Bus door to door service is really good with reasonable price. Security staff are not friendly not pleasant experience. They are trying to improve the services but still long way to go.I was pleasantly surprised : no queues at check in no queues at security. As regards arrivals nothing changed yet but everything worked properly. Overall a very pleasant experience.Arrival into terminal 2B is great - departure is another thing. Check in is a bit of a mess with the counters being opened two hours before hand and no real queue system in place. Security is very thorough - I was practically stripped searched - but no real problems - something you have to put up with these days. Biggest problem is signage - or lack of. Trying to get your tax back is fun and you need a lot of patience. Otherwise not a bad airport some good food places but on the steep side.If you are flying with a no frills airline chances are you\\'ll be using Terminal 1. This is a very cramped terminal and you really don\\'t want to be spending much time here. Having said that the Duty Free shop is fine and for the smokers you\\'ll be able to stock up on very low priced cigarettes. The terminal is very stuffy and far too warm but you will find two refreshment areas.Taxis to/from airport very expensive public transport difficult. Travelling with pushchair in Budapest is a nightmare guess this is true for wheelchair users to. Baby changing facilities are rubbish : one table one mat and one chair. No picures or colours on the wall no toys. Cleanliness is ok. Restaurants are expensive. T1 (Low cow cost airlines) Spent 45 minutes queing at check in. Getting through the gate was not difficult as we got priority with the baby. T2 (other airlines) A town called Vecsas is close so anyone can do a late shopping (pharmacy shops). Arriving is much smoother and faster no hassle and queue at passport check.You need to arrive at least 2 hours in advance 3 if you like to be on the safe side. This airport is much too small (extension works on-going). There are only 5 booths open for all Malev Economy flights and the queue is terrible. They urge you to use the self-checking screens but you have to queue anyway to leave your luggage. Attendants do their best. When you are at least out of this queue you are in for a second one for the safety check which is aslo vastly undersized. Not much in term of shops or drinking/eating. The number of seats available at the gates is ridiculous. then you have the luck to board by Bus. I hope their future extension will be well designed because for the time being it is not an airport you want to use.There were incredible queues at check-in and even longer ones at security check. We spent an hour and a half in the queue to pass the security checks without any kind of order. Moreover the staff at security check rude and hardly communicate in English. We really feel treated more like animals than as people.This airport is a nightmare both at check in and security. It took us 2 hours and this only because we sneaked under the barriers to avoid missing our flight which as it happened was delayed by over an hour anyway. Avoid if at all possible.This airport has been downgraded by EU authorities because of security issues. Had to wait long for Star Alliance check-in (I had my sport bike). Schengen terminal 2 only 1 x-ray machine attended with enormous queuing. BUD-FRA-BRU in FRA they made again a full security check even checked my shoes and said Budapest now is a 3rd world airport sorry for inconvenience. So stressful and quite abusing.Arrival at Ferihegy is a bit deceiving. The direct train to the city is a joke the station lies in the vicinity of low-cost Terminal 1 while most of passengers arrive at Terminal 2 which is connected with T1 and the railway station by public road usually congested with urban traffic. At the remote railway stop there are no amenities for disabled passengers and no information at all. The real nightmare is the departure and transit. Taken into account incredible queues at check-in and then even longer queues at security check you should come to the airport well ahead the time the airlines suggest. Staff at security check is harsh and rude and hardly communicate in English. Due to the lack of space and insufficient number of gates in the Schengen terminal the crowds of passengers make it difficult to move not to say about places to seat. The only positive thing you see are the posters and leaflets saying how wonderful spacious and friendly the airport will be in future when the construction of new terminal is completed.Arrived at the airport terminal 2A and got a shock to see the unbelievable huge crowd at Star Alliance check-in. The end of the row was at the entrance of the airport. Seems LH and AUA don\\'t really care of this situation weeks ago I was waiting 25 minutes for drop-off in the same time. I will think twice to use Swiss if check-in will be pooling into a big maze. Security improved a lot not waiting for long and they were friendly. Airside hard to find any free place to sit down on that Saturday afternoon restroom was clean. Many announcements were not clearly understandable thus I nearly miss my flight.T2B. Prompt passport control (non-EU national) but baggage was slow. Travelling out : a 15min BA check-in queue but aggravated by 20 minutes to get through a crowded security area. The extension of T2 now underway is well overdue. In terms of landside access a ticket for the 200E bus can be purchased from the newsagents but to get a 3day or 7day pass you need to get to the underground station at Kobanya-Kispet. This is a nuisance as it should be possible to get these tickets at the airport. However can recommend the hotel shuttle service for timeliness and value-for-money.I have just had enough of the way check-in staff feel they can treat passengers at Ferihegy. I am not sure why repeatedly I get talked at as if I am an unwelcome alien. The only time I saw any personnel smile was when security found a jar of Slovak mustard and lobbed it into the bin happily. While I don`t object to this being termed a liquid if it must be I was rather surprised to say the least to hear the security guard a woman make a negative remark about me in Hungarian assuming I could not understand I think. I\\'ll be flying into another airport when going back to Hungary.Passed through BUD Terminal 2B 12 times in the last half year. Check-in usually takes a bit of time and can be extremely crowded so it is good to be there 90 minutes before your flight - except if you have already checked in online. Check-in staff not especially nice or helpful. There is only 4 check-in machine for Malev flights however this is their main hub and those machines are usually out of order or frozen for several minutes. Passing security takes time and they can also be rude. The airside is crowded with good facilities but only a few place to sit - let\\'s hope that this will change with the current enlargement of the terminals. After boarding at peak times we often had to wait 5-10 minutes for the personnel of the airport to push back the plane from the standing position: there is not much capacity reserve for this at BUD. When arriving getting your luggage can take 5 minutes as well as 25 you should just cross your fingers and wait. I miss a central screen in the baggage reclaim area which would show which flight is delivered on which belt.Terminal 2B. Arrival waited 20 minutes for baggage but apart from that quickly through immigration. Departure check in area very crowded but checked in took about 10 minutes through security in 5 minute. Departure lounge good with good food outlets.Aerolineas Argentinas\\' departure terminal is primitive and chaotic. Instead of everyone standing in one check-in line and being served by the next available agent, you stand in line by flight. The lines snake through the building and there is no one to tell you what you are supposed to do. The check-in area was dirty and overcrowded. Our gate was at a beautiful, new part of the airport with a few services. But, getting there from check-in is stressful and very unpleasant. The road to the airport was strewn with burned cars from rioting over power failures during the heat wave. I don\\'t recommend this airport, but if you are flying international, it is your only option.A nice airport: Convenient for city good flight arrival and departure displays. Relaxed atmosphere. Rapid and straightforward security. Security people pleasant and helpful. Decent range of places to buy food. Clean toilets Plenty of seats in gate area. Bus ride to and from plane (if needed) short. Bags arrive quickly. Taxis outside airport well organized.Much improved infrastructure relative to my previous visit February 2011. Immigration (passport control) took 15 minutes despite huge lines (at least one other large international flight clearly landed just before ours from ATL). 32 passport control lines all staffed (why doesn\\'t the US do this?). Another 5 minutes to send luggage through X-ray at customs. That\\'s the time to nip over to Banco National to get Argentine currency at good exchange rate. Easy and convenient to get taxicab to center of city at kiosk in center of arrivals hall. Leaving spent 15 seconds in outgoing passport control. Both entry and exit passport control officers actually smiled!I flew from EZE last Wednesday to Mexico with Turkish Airlines connecting in Sao Paulo. New Terminal is just bright and happy with nice bars and cool duty free shops. Star Alliance VIP is nice and offers a lot it looks like a furniture show room but it does the job. I made connection in GRU then Panama and finally Mexico and EZE is by far the nicest airport nor the biggest or the easiest. Overall really nice experience.Arrived from LHR at 0830 after 13hr flight non stop with BA. Immigration queue was OK took about 20 mins which meant our luggage was waiting on the carousel. Then it all went haywire. Air France Iberia Lufthansa and Alitalia flights all arrived within an hour of ours so imagine about 1000 people plus suitcases trying to get through customs. 6 lines all formed in a very haphazard way which then moulded into 4 lines for 4 x-ray machines. This took us an hour to get through and into arrival hall. Another 90 mins standing there while our holiday reps organised coach transport. International Terminal A and the surrounding roads can\\'t cope at peak times for all these arrivals. Our departure was much smoother I\\'m pleased to say. Luggage drop off fine security queue took about 10 mins passport control about the same. Stayed in the LAN lounge which is close to our departure gate (10). The departure lounge is modern I hope they do something about the Arrivals hall which leaves a lot to be desired.It\\'s been almost 2 years since the last time I used this airport and a lot has changed since. My flight - JFK via GIG arrived at gate 2 located in a very dated sector of terminal A. I know this part of the airport is scheduled to undergo improvements it really needs it but it looks like they\\'ve already started and some changes can be seen already like the new passport control area with many more passport desks located in the ground floor and brand new carrousels that replaced the very noisy old ones. Even so baggage claims still looks dated. I arrived at noon so passport control took less than 10 minutes. When I got to baggage claim my bags were already on the carrousel. Since every piece of luggage must be screened at customs there was a long line and it took me around 30 minutes to clear customs. The arrivals hall hasn\\'t changed a bit - old and dark not the most welcoming. I got to the airport 4 hours prior to my flight because I was flying with a puppy. The check-in hall of terminal A is modern and very bright. Check-in was pretty quick and they let me check my bags and check the kennel with the puppy later. TAM Airlines personnel were kind and helpful as well as airport\\'s employees. There was no line for security but there was a very long one for passport control - 30 minutes or more. I checked the screens and found out that my flight was already boarding at gate 10. Sadly I had to rush through Ezeiza\\'s lovely free-shop in order to get to the gate on time. Gate 10 is located in a new building that replaces the old terminal B with very nice boarding areas great views of one of the runways and new concessions like Starbucks and Quilmes (Argentina\\'s most famous beer). I didn\\'t have time to wander through this new area that houses gates 8 to 23 but it looks spacious and pretty nice.Took just under an hour in the PM rush hour from downtown to EZE but the taxi arrived about 15 mins late due to tie up in microcentro. United told us to give 3 hours but they opened their desks 30 minutes late resulting in line ups. Excellent Global Alliance Gold check in economy looked efficient as well. It took just 30 minutes to get through security and immigration. More efficient than US. Airside very limited United lounge OK.Airport personnel very bad long lines for emigration and customer. The terminal facilities are not good there are too many free shops in areas where should be only for passengers after you arrive and pass emigration you have to go through a free shop in order to get the baggage claim sector.The main problem of EZE airport are queues. Several times I had to wait more than half an hour to pass immigration control (both on departure and arrival). Waiting times for check-in security control and customs control on arrival are only slightly better. Other issues are totally overpriced duty-free shops. Prices are crazy.Used EZE on a resent trip to BAires and was pleasantly surprised. Travelling on Air France and although the plane parks at Terminal C you actually arrive into Terminal B. The line for immigration can be long but just make sure you are in the right one. When I was there the line for Argentines was much longer than the non- Argentine one. Staff at immigration and customs were professional. Once through to land-side things can be a little hectic. On Departure Air France use Terminal C which is brand new. Immigration was fast and friendly. Terminal C has two places to eat a large Duty Free area and a few smaller stores. It does not however have a currency exchange facility so I would recommend changing most of your Pesos before leaving for the airport.This is a very nice clean and functional airport. It is not anything elaborate but it gets the job done and is miles ahead of other South American airports. The lines for check-in with TAM were quick and the security checkpoints and passport control were fast and efficient. The gates in Terminal A are spacious with plenty of seating and the terminal has good signage in both Spanish and English. A very pleasant experience overall.I had no problems arriving in or leaving EzeizaI arrived almost five hours prior my flight thinking I would have time to shop and eat dinner. It took me up to 2.5 hours to check in to AA. The airport was crowded. There was a strike on the way to the airport and many people came late. After that almost 1.5 hours to pass security line. There are some nice stores in the duty free. The airport is small considering the volume of passengers and old but well maintained.Arrived almost 3 hrs before my flight. I was flying First Class so it only took 20 mins to check my bags I probably would have missed my flight if I\\'d been in general check-in. The line for security stretched halfway through the terminal. It was a little more than 30 mins to the ID check. Once through that there was another long queue to get through security - of the 5 lanes only 3 were open and took 45 mins to clear. Customers took another 30 mins to clear. That left just enough time for a quick stop in the American lounge before our flight was announced.I found it a very good experience and better than many airports in the UK. There are two terminals. A is new clean and used by international airlines. B is old and (I believe) only used by some Aerolineas Argentinas flights. Arriving in terminal A I was outside having collected my bags in 30 minutes. Checking in opened 4 hours before the flight and I was through quickly. Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores. I watched an amusing episode where two people cut each other up got out and hugged/chatted then cut each other up again trying to exit the drop off zone. Airside I found perfume to be cheap but everything else relatively expensive by local standards.This airport is a nightmare. Immigration control can take up to 1h 30min like it happened to me. It just needs 2 planes arriving at the same time. Customs procedure the same. Leaving the country is no different but worse. Make sure you arrive in time for check-in and passport control especially in the evening when many intercontinental flights depart. I recommend at least 2h before departure. Duty-free area is good for South American airports and good prices.Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague\\'s flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don\\'t use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited. In winter poor foggy weather can cause major flight delays so be prepared!I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren\\'t common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time. The trip from downtown Buenos Aires can easily take 1.5 to 2 hours during rush hour. The public transport to/from the airport is adequate.I wish more airports offered the excellent Customer Service that Aeropuertos Argentinas does at Ezeiza with fully manned desks and helpful staff. During my trip this month I ran into delayed flights cancelations and even a strike by Aerolineas Argentinas staff. Speaking little Spanish I couldn\\'t have managed without this superb organization. I have used them on arrival to have porters available as my wife and I can no longer handle heavy luggage.EZE has been upgraded over the years and arrival experience is much better than before. Luckily arrived this time at 1130 with TAM and into an almost empty immigration hall. It can be chock a block when several flights from Europe / USA arrive at once but my worst wait was no more then 30 minutes. Baggage claim straightforward. A word to the uninitiated - do not consider changing money in the arrivals hall or area immediately outside other than at the Banco de la Nacion. BNA offered usd $1 for ARS $390 the going rate. I saw the other places offering $330. Taxi Ezeiza (safereliable and prepaid at the kiosk ) is ARS $118 into town but only ARS $88 for the return. Do not consider a verbal offer from anyone in the arrivals area. Departing processes are straightforward again depending upon time of day and the Duty Free shopping is quite good. Toilet facilities airside could do with modernisation but are clean.Arrived 3 hours prior to international flight and no queues at check-in but then it was a 2 am flight. Little security at xray but we found out why later. As we arrived at 10pm the few shops were shutting. Old sparse seating which was shiny with dirt. nothing to do except eat in a small expensive restaurant which was totally out of place. Went to board flight and got our bags emptied by stupid desk clerks who thought they knew what they were doing (explains lack of previous security desk clerks cheaper than security who might actually know what they are doing). Made us drink all water before getting on plane despite policy of allowing beverages on a plane that have been purchased after security (didnt make people drink alcohol!). Took my anti-bacterial handgel off me as said it was flammable pointed out global pandemic (and flying Aerolineas Argentinas it is essential!) she stated there was no pandemic any more! Couldn\\'t be bothered arguing the point of alcoholic drinks and flammability. Other terminal is slightly better but only arrived there and out again. Baggage area is small but getting a taxi to hotel easy but dont go with luxury cars in immediate arrivals go to taxi desk in arrivals hall cheaper and very efficient set price too so no nasty surprises.Late evening check in for my FRA bound flight took 3 minutes. This is a remarkable fact since this is prime time at EZE airport with many long haul flights departing for SE Asia the Americas and Europe. No need any more to go to another window to pay the mandatory airport tax which saves some minutes/hassle. This is included in your fare if ticket has been purchased after March 2009. No queues/delays at security. Even when at least 100 people where waiting in line for passport control it took no more than 10 minutes in an ever moving queue since all 20 booths were manned and moving fast. Take that Miami airport! Inside the terminal relaxed feeling due to its spaciousness public areas etc.I have flown in and out of EZE a handful of times in the last couple of years as I have family in Argentina and cannot remember any problems. Ok there were horrible queues once as I was departing and not a lot of places for sitting down the cafes are getting expensive but other than that I\\'d say it\\'s good. I have flown Iberia and TAM so not sure if that\\'s part of the equation. I would agree that Tierra Leon is good for transport to and from the airport but if there\\'s two or more adults you get a taxi for the same price. (Tierra Leon don\\'t charge for two year olds and indeed free transfer from where they stop in the city to Retiro from where you can catch a long distance bus- and these are good! Can get one leaving a few hrs or sooner after you get there for a decent price!) In fact long distance coach travel all over South America is good in my experience but that belongs under a different topic obviously.I was dreading returning to the States via the Buenos Aires Airport after reading the reviews. While the airport is inefficient and the processes disorganized the actual experience was not as horrible as I thought it would be. I think I got there just before the big crush of people for the evening flights back to the States which undoubtedly helped. My advice: It\\'s a waste of time to check in on-line for a Delta flight. The Delta staff insist on printing boarding passes and just won\\'t accept the on-line version. Contrary to what you may hear there are no automated check-in machines at the airport. I was told there were 2 for Delta - there are actually none. Security is convoluted and not reassuring. You go through luggage \"security\" prior to getting in line to get your boarding pass at the main passenger desk. I saw no value in the process but they dig out the paper print out they have for your reservation and hand it to you to take with your luggage to the desk. Fortunately the check-in line was short but had lengthened by the time I finished. You get your boarding passes at the main desk and they check in your checked baggage. No problem with this part of the process and my luggage arrived just fine at JFK. You next pay your $18 tax to exit Argentina. The tax booth is now in the middle of the international airlines main passenger service area so very convenient. Less than 5 minutes but again the line had grown and I think I just lucked out. There was a tax window upstairs as well but it didn\\'t look staffed. You next fill out your immigration form and take it your receipt for your tax payment and your carry-on baggage to go through Security. One station operating and over a 100 people in line. But don\\'t worry it\\'s not very thorough so the line moves quickly - less than 30 minutes. Fast but not a feeling of confidence. You find your departure gate after walking through an expansive duty- free area - don\\'t bother buying water at this point as they won\\'t let you take it through the next security check. You clear a mini-security as the final step prior to boarding. Very quick - line again moves quite fast. If you need to leave gate area to use bathroom you have to re-clear this security check. But it\\'s fast. Refund of VAT - I didn\\'t go through this process as I didn\\'t buy much so I can\\'t comment. Overall I found the people friendly and helpful - the entire process took about 1 hour 15 minutes but I believe that if you arrive at 7 or 8pm the process could take the 3 hours you read about.Flew in and out December - January to and from Europe. I was prepared for a hard time in an airport which has not attracted good (or even adequate) reviews but it was not too bad. Upon arrival (mid morning) my only comment would be that Immigration was heavily overloaded although they did their best to process us as fast as possible. Luggage delivery time was quite reasonable. We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration. I think this time could be very much longer at peak times since the queue snaked a long way at a reasonably quiet time of the day.I have flown into and out of Ezeiza several times in the last 2 years. I just arrived in BA yesterday and the immigration baggage claim and customs area seem to have been re-done and are a lot more efficient. I enjoy the fact that you can duty-free shop entering Argentina! Departure is less organized but I check in using the business class queue (American Airlines) which usually takes only 10-15 minutes at the worst (the economy queue is always very long). Taxi Ezeiza is always a safe bet for transport into the city a kiosk right in the center of the floor when you exit customs. They are fast and efficient at a published rate that is always cheaper than the remises (and they offer a cheaper rate from the city to EZE - call to make an appointment when you leave).I\\'ve traveled through EZE a couple of times in the last month. Arrival is no problem and I had no problems getting a reasonably cheap taxi to the centre from the kiosk outside the terminal. Where EZE is lacking is at check in. I\\'ve checked in on different occasions for flights to the US with Delta and to Europe with Lufthansa. In both cases I arrived with a good 3 hours to spare and had to queue for at least 1.5 hours to check in for Economy. In both cases the queue snaked outside the roped off area and down the terminal! They really need more staff and more open check in desks for Economy. With less than 1 hour to boarding there was till a massive queue for a 747 flight - which ended up leaving late. Don\\'t forget you have still to queue to pay airport tax security screening and passport check So arrive early folks!Most comments are concerning EZE the international airport outside of town. The domestic airport near the city center is smaller and simpler but relatively modern with plenty of dining options. Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates. The national bank branch giving the best rates is outside of security and a couple of turns to the right. Not at all obvious. Ditto on taxis: those easiest to find are very pricey. For cheaper ones you need to hunt a bit outside.Buenos Aires airport can be somewhat frustrating but compared to transiting through Washington Dulles en route to Canada it is a breeze. Upon arrival it takes some time in the queue to clear Immigration. You will be given a copy of your Immigration declaration put this away somewhere safe as you may be asked for it on departure. However the real problem  unless you can carry your baggage manually is the shortage of luggage carts. They are provided free of charge but there just aren\\'t enough of them. I had to wait 30 minutes before airport staff finally arrived with some but friends who arrived later never did get one and had to man-handle their luggage to Customs. If you do have to wait for a cart you can use the opportunity to exchange US dollars at the bank that is adjacent to the Customs exit area - it\\'s the one that airline staff use and they give a fair exchange rate. Clearance through Customs posed no problems once I got a cart but if you are taking a taxi downtown be extremely cautious. Do not under any circumstances accept the offer of taxi touts outside the airport offering to get you a cab - you can get badly burnt. Use only those yellow cabs parked at the official rank which you will see on exiting the airport. When leaving the best bet is to book a \"remise\" - a car that will pick you up and charge a pre agreed amount. In my case it cost 70 pesos from downtown to the airport. Airport departure procedures are more complex and frustrating than arrival. First you need to queue to obtain a boarding pass and the time this takes seems to vary from day to day. I went through in about 15 minutes but my friends took far longer than that. Next if you are going to claim a tax refund on purchases you will need to queue at the Customs booth - same ground floor level as the airline desks - to get your tax forms (the ones provided by the stores where you made your purchases) stamped. Next go upstairs to the tax refund office and queue once more to obtain your refund. This should not take more than 10 minutes. You will have the option of immediate payment in Argentine pesos or dollars which can be credited to a credit card. I took the cash as I will be returning to BA again. Next you have to queue once more to pay your airport departure tax - adjacent to the tax refund office. This can be paid in US dollars ($18.00) the equivalent in pesos or by credit card. When this is done you will go through initial screening next to the airport tax counter. Once inside you will next have to queue to pass Immigration. There is a form that has to be filled out - available at airline check-in desk - and you may possibly also be asked for the Immigration form you were give when arriving. Once this is done you are basically done until boarding time whan your hand luggage will be manually examined prior to boarding. To be sure of getting through all these procedures on time one should allow 2 1/2 hours to be on the safe side. And best eat before leaving for the airport as there is nothing much available at the airport in the way of food.I connected from SCL to ORD via EZE. I concur with the comment that prices are obscenely expensive. I bottle of soda was 7.50 Arg. pesos. There is really only one place to eat after security in the international (non-AR) terminal. There\\'s a fair amount of shopping but food and beverage options are very limited.EZE airport is clean modern european style. Only downside is that the it is extremely expensive the prices are too much It seem that the airport operator has a monopoly and they control all the shops. I loved the airport the people and the city but that the prices are too much.My wife and I took the Manuel Tienda Deleon coach from the airport to Buenas Aires last Wednesday. Some 20 minutes after we were dropped at our hotel I received a phone call to my room from the Manager of the coach company. It seems the driver had noticed that I had inadvertently given him $100 along with the $10 tip I had intended. He immediately returned to the hotel with the $100. Let\\'s say I was a very happy camper and very impressed with the driver\\'s honesty. A great first impression of Buenas Aires.I visit Buenos Aires 2 or more times per year and while the city remains great Ezieza Airport is becoming more of a mess each time I visit. In all fairness arrivals are usually OK - in January I deplaned went thru Immigration claimed my bags and was on my way within 30 minutes. Try that in Chicago or JFK ! Now for the bad news: departures are a disaster - I would recommend arriving 3 hours early even if flying First/Business Class. I took nearly an hour to get checked in for a Business Class passenger then you pay the airport tax and head upstairs to security (a breeze) and Argentine Exit Stations (slow) . Boarding Areas are filthy and feature broken down chairs! A final cursory search of your hand luggage occurs at boarding - then you have an 8-11 flight back to the USA. What a mess.I was trying to find a parking spot for more than 70 minutes in the only small enclosed parking and finally I left to park outside. Can\\'t believe an airport with that traffic and weather don\\'t have a covered parking area for people who would like to pay for it. Really bad service.Excellent option travelling from Toronto Canada. Quick drive to apt check-in is a breeze as only single flight scheduled at desk smaller aircraft means smaller line-ups everywhere. Security was thorough but very quick - no rush no herding. Apt is spacious enough to handle the crowd. No walking endlessly. Collect baggage and walk out to the outside in a minute. The ride to the apt from Toronto is not at all bad allow 2.5 hrs travel time door to door from the middle of Toronto. Will always be my only choice for North American travel. Food options not much air-side.K George is right on the money. As we were getting our things out of our car for our flight the Parking Shuttle guy patiently waited for us and helped more than most do. We flew out on Southwest and in on US Airways. Buffalo works well for SW as there is very little time wasted for taxiing so planes can get in and get out quickly. The airport is bright and easy to use. Be advised that the Jetway does not get lowered for regional jets so if its a rainy day and you are on a CRJ or ERJ to BUF have a newspaper handy to hold over your head!BUF is a great smallish airport to fly into and out of. Security moves quickly the lines are short and it\\'s very convenient for pick-up/drop-off and rentals. Upon arrival you can literally be in your car with baggage within 20 mins. Parking is expansive and cheap and there are always friendly drivers ready to pick you up at your car or drive you to it after arrival. The airport itself is bright and inviting- very well designed. It is also large enough to have a pretty good selection of flights- there are about 30 or so gates and probably a dozen or so airlines. You can\\'t always get a direct flight but the options are not bad at all. My only gripe is there are only a few restaurant choices but since BUF is rarely a changeover it\\'s not somewhere you\\'ll usually spend a lot of time anyway.Buf appears to be a nice little airport with friendly staff who are very efficient and treat customers with respect. The downside being airside shops and restaurants facilities are rather poor compared to other airports. The airport waiting areas are not too bad and gates quite near to each other. Quite a pleasant airport to fly into and out of.I live in the Niagara Region on the Ontario Canada side and grew up in the Buffalo area. At one time it was common for Americans to trek to Toronto in order to obtain the best selection of flights at reasonable prices. Buffalo used to have three ancient small terminal buildings very limited parking and a small cartel of airlines operating out of it. Since the new airport in Buffalo has been built the range of airline choice and scheduling has grown and prices have fallen. Toronto on the other hand with its growth and congestion has become increasingly more expensive and although the drive from here is barely more than an hour that\\'s hypothetical because traffic is always so bad in TO then if that\\'s not enough parking is a nightmare you have to walk great distances to get to and inside of the terminals and now regardless of where you want to fly to it\\'s much more expensive even after taking exchanges into consideration. We can leave our home be at Buffalo- Niagara in less than 45 minutes parking is plentiful and cheap but because it\\'s such a hassle-free trip it\\'s never any problem to get someone to do a drop off. You can just get in and out of there fast. I do agree the security barriers were placed in the most awkward part of the airport severely limiting the access to more shops and restaurant choices. The baggage carrousel area is also a bit tight when a few flights arrive at once but again these are small problems compared to the ease and reasonable prices. And for domestic flights within the US when you live in Canada you can entirely avoid customs when arriving and just drive from the airport and do your declarations at whatever bridge and it\\'s so much easier. It\\'s nice to be in this area and have the choice of airports - to include Hamilton which is making travel within Canada easier for us in this region.Like some of the other reviewers here I\\'m a Canadian that uses BUF as an alternative to Toronto Pearson International. The reason is simple - - for flights within the United States it\\'s vastly cheaper to fly from Buffalo -- On one occasion recently I was able to make a flight out of Buffalo for literally half what it would have cost from Toronto (all taxes included). Two significant reasons why Buffalo is cheaper -- Firstly Pearson charges possibly the highest landing fees in the world and second the United States TSA charges higher security fees for trans-border versus U.S. domestic flights. One review of Buffalo Airport complained about it being hard to fly anywhere direct from Buffalo but I suspect that most airports are like that these days. With one connection you can get to most places from Buffalo. My one issue with the airport is that it was designed in the pre-9/11 era and nearly all the airport facilities (stores restaurants etc.) are in the secure area so there isn\\'t much to do for people waiting for arriving flights.Southwest and Jet Blue offer a cheap alternative to us Canadians but airport fees at YYZ adding 80% to a fare is somewhat of an exaggeration. This airport is not a travel friendly place one of the coldest and most impersonal airports I have ever been in. The parking system is quite expensive and very disorganized the shuttle buses wander aimlessly and don\\'t pick up on a first come first served basis. The day we left there were noisy sirens and alarms going off all the time and all the staff just ignored them and my eardrums just hummed and I couldn\\'t hear anything that was going on. While the food sold was good there was very little selection (apart from Burger King before security every outlet had the same menu) and the prices were exorbitant.BUF is an excellent airport as a second choice for Toronto people flying to Chicago Northeastern USA and Florida especially you are travelling with a whole family. Southwest fare from BUF to Florida is so low CAD150 include tax round trip for family of four flying from BUF to Florida can save you a lots of money! BUF itself is small user- friendly and just 1.5 hours from Toronto. I did that before - park my car check in security boarding all in 35 mins!Have been using this airport as an alternative to Pearson Intl (YYZ- Toronto) because of Pearson’s outrageous airport fees. I have routinely bought an airline ticket thinking that it was a great price only to find out that the airport fees add another 80% to the ticket. Buffalo Intl is an ok airport its quite small but it gets the job done. One problem with this airport is the paltry number of flights that leave the airport. Unless you live in the Northeast it is almost impossible to fly without connecting somewhere. The only other gripe that I have is that the food selection at the airport is rather poor.The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn\\'t even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren\\'t left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it\\'s just a crazy yet brilliant experience!This is a very basic and small airport. Facilities are limited. Most parts of the airport are covered but are not air conditioned relying on natural ventilation. Mosquitoes could be a problem at some times. Fortunately there are not too many staff hassling for your money. baggage reclaim was reasonably efficient. No real problems departing. Again there are very limited facilities. There are a couple of shops selling the usual tourist fare and expensive bottles of alcohol. The bar/café is not bad but is overpriced - $5 for a simple snack. The business lounge is nothing more than a room with a TV.Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal siteBurbank provides a convenient and easy alternative to LAX although the departure hall in Terminal B is too small to accommodate more than 2 flights at a time. There were 4 flights (an MD-80 a 737 and 2 CRJ regional jets) boarding simultaneously and the small space and cramped conditions caused confusion and delayed boarding for everyone.Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.Burbank is a very small regional airport serving the San Fernando Valley and northern Los Angeles suburbs with only 12 gates and no jetways but it\\'s a very good alternative to the chaos that is LAX. There are flights on Southwest (dominant carrier) United US Airways JetBlue American and Alaska to all major western USA airports plus Dallas/Ft. Worth and New York JFK. The terminal is very small and can get overcrowded during peak times and food/beverage/concession options are very Spartan but it\\'s easy to navigate has excellent free wi-fi and the security screening process is streamlined and well-run. You can also walk from the terminal to the long-term parking lot which you can\\'t do at LAX.BUR provides a pleasant alternative to LAX. The terminal complex is a bit small so during peak times it can get crowded but security and check-in lines move quickly. There are no jetways but being in California weather is seldom an issue and it\\'s quite nice walking onto the tarmac to board your plane by stairs. If you\\'re in a wheelchair they will use a mechanical lift to raise you to the aircraft door. The food and shopping offerings are bare bones and quite disappointing. If using the Metrolink rail is convenient to your travel BUR is an excellent alternative because there is a station across the street from the terminal but the airport is a bit difficult to get to by road because there is no freeway access within 2 miles. Traffic at rush hour can be difficult.Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns. Today BUR is convenient airport for those wishing to avoid LAX. You pick up your bags from the baggage conveyor belt outside the terminal.Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.This airport is incongruous. On the one hand the food service stand such that it is is a cave. I am kind of worried that Sloth is hiding in the shadows. The music - effeminate EuroPop from the late 1980s - think Frankie Goes to Hollywood - just does not match the interior that may never have been renovated. Then you\\'ve got the external baggage claim. And Southwest. And JetBlue And a large mountain dominating the horizon. Once the DEA interrogated me on a tip during my business trip. And the exterior looks ripped out of 1973. It\\'s all very bizarre.Burbank airport is a welcome relief from LAX. It\\'s small and yes does not have the amenities of a large modern airport but those are its strong points. It\\'s a \"human scale\" airport the type that is fast disappearing. The convenience of the train station and the freeways makes it a great place to fly from.Just flew through BUR a couple of times. What a quaint little airport straight out of the 1930\\'s. I\\'m sure it was fine for DC-3\\'s but it struggles immensely with 737\\'s. Christopher Schmidt mentions that terminal A is narrow. Well I flew out of terminal B and I thought that it was exceptionally narrow. Burbank is well located and fares are good but if you go there patience and a happy disposition will be great virtues. Also don\\'t expect to get somewhere to sit while you\\'re waiting.Eat before you go to the airport. The food outlets offer items that were packaged during the Reagan administration! Terminal A (Southwest/America West) is extremely narrow! Terminal B (American/Alaska/Delta/United) is quite efficientMy trip through the Burbank Airport was a mixed experience. The passenger terminal has a run-down appearance to it that is in need of updating. Carpeting and wall paneling do not seem to have been upgraded in a while. The terminal lacks jet bridges and the baggage claim conveyor is out of doors which I actually find quite pleasant when the weather is nice but awful during rainstorms. The food and shopping options were minimal though I did not get a chance to check their prices. On the positive side however: the airport is very conveniently located for much of Los Angeles and has convenient access to the freeways. Despite the dilapidated look of the terminal it is a lot less confusing and intimidating than LAX - finding my way through the place was easy. The view of the mountains and desert outside of my airplane window on approach to the airport was enjoyable. The Southwest Airlines personnel did their jobs with the usual commendable levels of courtesy and professionalism and at no time did I find the lines to be too long.'"
